However, in these methods, communication\nacross workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the\nsynchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers.

However, the\nscarcity of paired garment-model data makes it challenging for existing methods\nto achieve high generalization and quality in VTON. Also, it limits the ability\nto generate mask-free try-ons. To tackle the data scarcity problem, approaches\nsuch as Stable Garment and MMTryon use a synthetic data strategy, effectively\nincreasing the amount of paired data on the model side. However, existing\nmethods are typically limited to performing specific try-on tasks and lack\nuser-friendliness. To enhance the generalization and controllability of VTON\ngeneration, we propose Any2AnyTryon, which can generate try-on results based on\ndifferent textual instructions and model garment images to meet various needs,\neliminating the reliance on masks, poses, or other conditions. Specifically, we\nfirst construct the virtual try-on dataset LAION-Garment, the largest known\nopen-source garment try-on dataset. Then, we introduce adaptive position\nembedding, which enables the model to generate satisfactory outfitted model\nimages or garment images based on input images of different sizes and\ncategories, significantly enhancing the generalization and controllability of\nVTON generation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nAny2AnyTryon and compare it with existing methods. The results show that\nAny2AnyTryon enables flexible, controllable, and high-quality image-based\nvirtual try-on generation.https://logn-2024.github.io/Any2anyTryonProjectPage/", upvotes=10, thumbnail=None),

To this end, we make use of our\nrecently released automated safety testing tool, named ASTRAL. By leveraging\nthis tool, we automatically and systematically generate and execute a total of\n1260 unsafe test inputs on both models. After conducting a semi-automated\nassessment of the outcomes provided by both LLMs, the results indicate that\nDeepSeek-R1 is highly unsafe as compared to OpenAI's o3-mini. Based on our\nevaluation, DeepSeek-R1 answered unsafely to 11.98% of the executed prompts\nwhereas o3-mini only to 1.19%.", upvotes=19, thumbnail=None)],

To address this,\nwe propose MatAnyone, a robust framework tailored for target-assigned video\nmatting. Specifically, building on a memory-based paradigm, we introduce a\nconsistent memory propagation module via region-adaptive memory fusion, which\nadaptively integrates memory from the previous frame. This ensures semantic\nstability in core regions while preserving fine-grained details along object\nboundaries. For robust training, we present a larger, high-quality, and diverse\ndataset for video matting. Additionally, we incorporate a novel training\nstrategy that efficiently leverages large-scale segmentation data, boosting\nmatting stability. With this new network design, dataset, and training\nstrategy, MatAnyone delivers robust and accurate video matting results in\ndiverse real-world scenarios, outperforming existing methods.', upvotes=13, thumbnail=None),

With the rise of embodied\nand agentic AI, where inputs primarily come from camera pixels, the need for a\nunified perception framework becomes increasingly evident. In this paper, we\npropose to unify all modalities (text, tables, code, diagrams, images, etc) as\npixel inputs, i.e. "Perceive Everything as Pixels" (PEAP). We introduce\nPixelWorld, a novel evaluation suite that unifies all the mentioned modalities\ninto pixel space to gauge the existing models\' performance. Our findings show\nthat (1) PEAP outperforms baseline with token-based input in multimodal\ndatasets, benefiting from unified input for better disambiguation, (2)\nsignificant declines in reasoning and coding capabilities across all models\nwhen processing pixel-based input, underscoring the need to enhance foundation\nmodels\' perceptual abilities, (3) larger models can maintain strong performance\non non-reasoning tasks under PEAP, while smaller models like Phi-3.5-V suffer\nsignificant performance degradation, (4) the attention pattern of PEAP is\nhighly aligned with text token input, (5) PEAP can be accelerated significantly\nby exploiting the spatial sparsity. We conclude that the existing frontier\nmodels are competent in pixel perception, however, there is still headroom for\nimprovement.

To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn\nand apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration\nof KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR)\nmethod is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into\ndiscrete codes (\\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We\nfurther design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as\nfeatures to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The\nexperiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised\nquantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the\nfine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link\nprediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity\ninstead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.', upvotes=12, thumbnail=None),

To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax),\nwhich replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax\ncan be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures.\nExperimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only\nachieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve\nperformance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an\nanalysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus\nattention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although\nmodels that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length\ngeneralization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some\nof this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either\nduring or after pretraining.", upvotes=11, thumbnail=None),

However, such predictive models, often called world\nmodels, have proven challenging to learn and are typically developed for\ntask-specific solutions with online policy learning. We argue that the true\npotential of world models lies in their ability to reason and plan across\ndiverse problems using only passive data. Concretely, we require world models\nto have the following three properties: 1) be trainable on offline,\npre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3)\nfacilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To realize this, we present DINO World\nModel (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing\nthe visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with\nDINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting\nfuture patch features. This design allows DINO-WM to achieve observational\ngoals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic behavior\nplanning by treating desired goal patch features as prediction targets. We\nevaluate DINO-WM across various domains, including maze navigation, tabletop\npushing, and particle manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that DINO-WM\ncan generate zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time without relying on\nexpert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models. Notably,\nDINO-WM exhibits strong generalization capabilities compared to prior\nstate-of-the-art work, adapting to diverse task families such as arbitrarily\nconfigured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and\nmulti-particle scenarios.', upvotes=9, thumbnail=None)]}
