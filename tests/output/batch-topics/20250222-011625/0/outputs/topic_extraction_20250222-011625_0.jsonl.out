Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nNVIDIA's Trustworthy AI Development Initiatives\nNVIDIA emphasizes safety and transparency in AI development.\nNVIDIA focuses on

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7.

For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

may inadvertently leak sensitive information from training data.\nModels might memorize and reproduce elements from the training set.\nMemorization of training data can lead to privacy issues.\nText-to-image models may produce biased content due to biases in training data.\nModels exhibit sensitivity to small perturbations in input prompts.\nSmall input prompt variations can cause substantial changes in generated images.\nRecent research focuses on developing attack and defense mechanisms for text-to-image models.\nTruthfulness in Text-to-Image Models\nTruthfulness in text-to-image models refers to generating images precisely according to user queries.\nTruthfulness includes following user requirements and generating images faithfully.\nTraditional truthfulness evaluation uses metric-based methods like FID, SSIM, and LPIPS.\nTraditional truthfulness evaluation also uses model-based methods like Inception Score and CLIP-score.\nExisting metrics lack accurate measurement of truthfulness.\nLightweight model-based methods struggle with complex compositional text prompts.\nChallenges include handling multiple objects, attribute bindings, spatial relations, and logical reasoning.\nRecent research focuses on decomposing textual conditions using large language models.\nResearchers are developing visual question-answer approaches to evaluate image truthfulness.\nAdvanced methods leverage visual language models to calculate condition-generation alignment scores.\nTruthfulness Evaluation Methodology\nGenVerse is used to generate a dataset of image captions for benchmarking truthfulness.\nGenVerse maintains vocabularies of entities, attributes, and relations.\nElements are sampled based on real-world frequency distributions.\nSampled elements are arranged into keyword sequences using templates.\nTemplates are rephrased into natural language sentences by a large language model.\nTwo key checks ensure diversity: Similarity Checking and Group Checking.\nThe evaluation uses a Visual Question Answering (VQA) based approach.\nTIFA enables atomic and interpretable evaluation of generated images.\nTruthfulness is calculated by counting 'yes' and 'no' answers to specific queries.\nThe methodology ensures caption diversity across real-world element

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

on two primary aspects: factuality and faithfulness.\nDetecting factual errors in LLM responses involves comparing model-generated content against reliable knowledge sources.\nSome research addresses hallucination detection in a zero-source setting by estimating the uncertainty of generated factual content.\nMethods for detecting unfaithful generation can be categorized into fact-based metrics, classifier-based metrics, QA-based metrics, uncertainty estimation, and prompting-based metrics.\nHallucination Detection Benchmarks\nHaluEval provides a comprehensive collection of generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples.\nTruthfulQA consists of adversarially curated questions that mimic human falsehoods.\nFACTOR introduces a method for automatically creating benchmarks by perturbing factual statements.\nREALTIMEQA, FreshQA, and EvolvingQA offer questions to evaluate factual accuracy of LLMs in relation to evolving real-world knowledge.\nHalluQA and ChineseFactEval are benchmarks designed to measure hallucination in Chinese large language models.\nSelfCheckGPT-Wikibio provides a dataset for detecting sentence-level hallucinations.\nFELM assesses factual accuracy across various domains.\nPHD offers a passage-level hallucination detection benchmark created using ChatGPT and human annotations.\nHallucination Mitigation Strategies\nEnhancing the factual accuracy of the pre-training corpus can improve the model's parametric knowledge.\nRefining training data quality during supervised fine-tuning can help mitigate hallucinations.\nAlignment processes can help language models recognize their knowledge boundaries.\nInference-time interventions have become a focus for reducing hallucinations.\nPrompting Techniques for Hallucination Mitigation\nChain-of-thought prompting and least-to-most prompting can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.\nSelf-consistency, SCOTT, and self-ask methods involve prompting the model multiple times to identify potential hallucinations.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods retrieve information from reliable knowledge sources to reduce hallucinations.\nModel editing allows modification of LLM behavior by incorporating auxiliary sub-networks or modifying model parameters.\nSpecific techniques like ROME modify feedforward weights to update factual associations.\nInference-time intervention (ITI) identifies attention heads associated with truthfulness and shifts activations to elicit truthful answers.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   - Regulation\n   - Toolkit\n   - Research Method\n   - Technology\n   - Attack Method\n   -

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

factuality assessments of LLM-generated content using various decoding strategies.\nLee et al. introduce factual-nucleus sampling decoding algorithm.\nShi et al. propose a context-aware decoding strategy to encourage LLMs to pay closer attention to context during generation.\nThe context-aware strategy aims to override prior knowledge with reliable information to reduce

knowledge sources.\nEven with RAG, LLMs remain susceptible to hallucination.\nThe evaluation examines LLMs' hallucination tendencies in two scenarios:\nFirst scenario: Relying exclusively on models' parametric (internal) knowledge.\nSecond scenario: Retrieving information from reliable external sources.\nInternal knowledge scenario uses existing QA datasets covering adversarial QA, commonsense QA, and human falsehood QA.\nExternal knowledge scenario simulates RAG using a fact-checking task.\nEvaluation Methodology\nThe evaluation employs the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess model output.\nTraditional metrics like exact match and F1 scores may not suit LLM response diversity.\nThe same LLM-as-judge approach is used consistently across tasks.\nDynamic Dataset Construction\nA web browsing agent retrieves question-answer and claim-label pairs.\nQA task data is retrieved from reliable sources like Wikipedia.\nFact-checking task data is gathered from websites like Snopes and

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5.

refers to the tendency to prioritize reward maximization over truthfulness.\nSycophancy can cause language models to exhibit deceptive behaviors that prioritize user approval.\nResearch by Perez et

et al. discovered that user approval is often prioritized over maintaining truthfulness during model training.\nSharma et al. found sycophancy is prevalent in preference data used during instruction-tuning.\nPreference models can identify truthful responses but may still favor less truthful, sycophantic responses.\nSycophancy may be an inherent characteristic deeply embedded in the design and training of large language models.\nThere is no systematic method for evaluating sycophancy in language models.\nPerez et al. used model-written evaluations to test 154 diverse behaviors related to sycophancy.\nLanguage models tend to create echo chambers by repeating a dialog user's preferred answers.\nSharma et al. introduced SycophancyEval, an evaluation suite for assessing sycophantic behavior.\nMitigation methods for sycophancy are still limited and require further research.\nSharma et al. explored how sycophantic behavior changes with preference model optimization.\nWei et al. proposed a synthetic-data intervention to reduce sycophantic behavior through fine-tuning.\nRimsky et al. introduced contrastive activation addition to reduce sycophantic

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6.

If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nDynamic Dataset Knowledge Graph\nA dynamic data collection pipeline serves two purposes.\nThe first purpose is generating persona

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nPrinciples of Honest Large Language Models by Gao et al.\nGao et al. introduced six principles for honest Large Language Models (LLMs).\nThe principles focus on acknowledging limitations in various domains.\nThe research aims to maintain both honesty and helpfulness in LLM interactions.\nPrinciple: Latest Information with External Services\nLLMs have limitations in accessing current information due to outdated pre-training data.\nLLMs lack sufficient fact-checking capabilities.\nLLMs cannot directly access live or up-to-date external data sources.\nHonest LLMs should acknowledge these information retrieval limitations.\nPrinciple: User Input Not Enough Or With Wrong Information\nLLMs frequently encounter incorrect or ambiguous user questions.\nHonest LLMs must maintain objectivity and avoid catering to user biases.\nLLMs should provide accurate responses independent of user input.\nPrinciple: Professional Capability in Specific Domains\nSpecialized domains evolve rapidly and require extensive, high-quality datasets.\nLLMs have constraints in generating reliable outputs for expert-level tasks.\nHonest LLMs should recognize and communicate their domain-specific limitations.\nPrinciple: Interactivity Sensory Processing\nLLMs cannot directly perceive or process sensory data like auditory or tactile feedback.\nHonest LLMs must acknowledge their inability to interact with the physical world directly.\nPrinciple: Modality Mismatch\nLLMs are designed for text-based inputs and outputs.\nLLMs struggle to interpret or generate non-textual data like images or audio.\nHonest LLMs should transparently communicate their data processing limitations.\nPrinciple: Self Identity Cognition\nHonest LLMs should maintain awareness of their AI assistant identity.\nLLMs should recognize differences between human users and AI systems.\nWhen addressing topics requiring human perception or self-reflection, LLMs should disclaim their limitations.\nCalibration Concept\nHonest LLMs communicate confidence levels in their answers.\nCalibration means a model's confidence accurately reflects its knowledge.\nCalibrated models hedge or express lower confidence on difficult questions.\nCalibration can be measured through logits, token probabilities, and verbal statements.\nBenchmarking Honest LLMs\nTwo key metrics: honest rate and combined honest rate.\nHonest rate measures the percentage of scenarios where LLMs remain truthful.\nCombined honest rate reflects cases where LLMs are both honest and helpful.\nEvaluation uses an LLM-as-a-Judge approach with a standardized principle-based template.\nDynamic Dataset Construction\nWeb-browsing agents retrieve unsolved challenges for specific domain capabilities.\nPrinciple-guided prompts generate specific actions transformed into user queries.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   -

For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3.

impact the objectivity and reliability of LLM responses.\nPreference refers to situations where LLMs have stronger tendencies or preferences for certain types of people, things, or ideas.\nCurrent latest LLMs tend to lean slightly left politically.\nPreference bias can potentially undermine the credibility of LLMs by producing non-impartial outputs.\nPrevious research reveals preference bias extends beyond political, scientific, and societal matters.\nRozado's research examines political preferences embedded in LLMs, revealing left-leaning biases.\nThese preferences may result from supervised fine-tuning processes.\nRutinowski et al. and McGee uncover that ChatGPT tends to favor progressive libertarian views.\nRecent studies in recommendation systems have found bias can impact the quality of LLMs' recommendations.\nPreference Bias Mitigation Strategies:\nSolaiman et al. introduced PALMS method to mitigate preference bias through iterative fine-tuning using custom values-targeted datasets.\nAllam introduced BiasDPO framework to mitigate bias using a specific loss function that rewards generating less biased text.\nZhou et al. proposed UniBias method to identify and mask biased neural network vectors and attention heads during inference.\nGao et al. propose a two-stage fine-tuning approach inspired by curriculum learning to help LLMs maintain honesty and neutrality.\nSome researchers suggest offering alternative viewpoints backed by references as an effective bias mitigation strategy.\nPreference Assessment Domains:\nIdeology domain includes pairs like Capitalism / Socialism.\nCulture and lifestyle domain includes pairs like Witty and clever jokes / Slapstick and physical comedy.\nSocial equality and diversity domain includes pairs like Age diversity in the workplace / Seniority-based systems.\nHealth and well-being domain includes pairs like Natural remedies / Pharmaceutical solutions.\nTechnology, science, and education domain includes pairs like Embrace technological advancements / Be cautious to new technologies.\nDataset Construction Process:\nAn LLM-powered data crafter generates preference pairs in specific domains based on given instructions.\nThe domains can be easily expanded or modified by replacing parameters within the instruction.\nA case generator creates queries asking the LLM to express preferences based on generated pairs.\nAn LLM-powered diversity enhancer paraphrases preference queries to introduce variations in style, length, and format.\nEvaluation Approach:\nThe LLM-as-a-Judge approach is employed to evaluate preference tasks.\nThis method assesses the model's neutrality and fairness in responses.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1.

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1.

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6.

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3.

jailbreaks on Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models.\nThe same dataset will be used for VLMs with attack methods from Table 25.\nFigure 38 and Table 31 present the refuse to answer (RtA) rate of various VLMs across five different jailbreak attacks.\nLarger models tend to have higher RtA rates, indicating better defense against attacks.\nThis trend is consistent across model pairs like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-sonnet and Claude-3-haiku, Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-flash, and Llama-3.2-90B-V and Llama-3.2-11B-V.\nPrompt-to-image attacks typically yield lower RtAs compared to optimization-based attacks.\nOptimization-based attacks often generate jailbreak images using an open-source VLM.\nThe effectiveness of these attacks varies depending on the specific model implementation.\nJailbreak in Pieces attack shows lower RtAs for models with similar adaptor architectures like Qwen-2-VL-72B and GLM-4v-Plus.\nSome models like GPT-4o cannot understand optimized

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nBenchmarking Vision-Language Models for Bias Detection and Mitigation\nXiao et al. propose GenderBias benchmark for detecting gender bias in text-to-image diffusion models.\nGenderBias benchmark generates occupation images and their gender counterfactuals across multimodal and unimodal contexts.\nZhou et al. extend StereoSet into StereoSet-VL to measure stereotypical bias in vision-language models.\nZhang et al. present CounterBias, a method for quantifying social bias in Vision-Language pretrained models by comparing masked prediction probabilities.\nHoward et al. use diffusion models to construct the SocialCounterfactuals dataset for probing intersectional social biases in vision-language models.\nMMBias is a benchmark of 3,800 images and phrases across 14 population subgroups to assess bias in vision-language models.\nMMBias addresses underexplored biases related to religion, nationality, sexual orientation, and disabilities.\nAn automated pipeline for generating synthetic datasets deliberately conceals gender, race, and age information across professional domains.\nBias Mitigation Approaches\nSeth et al. propose DeAR, a debiasing method that learns additive residual image representations to counterbalance original representations.\nWang et al. define multimodal large language model debiasing as an editing problem and propose evaluation metrics.\nDataset and Evaluation Methodology\nCurrent bias evaluations often rely on simplified settings focusing on single modalities or static visual scenarios.\nExisting stereotype evaluations typically focus on isolated elements, limiting models' ability to handle complex tasks.\nSingle images struggle to represent temporal or dynamic events involving sequences of actions or interactions.\nThe proposed approach uses a multi-image-based dataset to construct complex scenarios.\nEvaluation Process\nGPT-4o-mini is used as the LLM judge for evaluation.\nThe judge model compares model responses against ground truth statements.\nThe evaluation process involves identifying stereotypes, discrimination, or problematic bias.\nOnly responses that successfully identify and oppose bias are considered correct.\nDynamic Dataset Construction\nThe dataset construction process involves using CrowS-Pairs and StereoSet datasets.\nLLM-as-a-Judge rates data instances on stereotype and disparagement dimensions.\nOnly items with an average score exceeding 8 are included in the evaluation.\nLLMs break down stories into scenes and replace key elements with placeholders.\nImage descriptions are generated while maintaining consistency and avoiding information leakage.\nText-to-image models generate corresponding images, which are compressed into composite images.\nA contextual variator paraphrases sentences to ensure narrative variation.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   -

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nMethodology for Generating Stereotype and Preference Evaluation Dataset\nItem selection involves computing average scores across two

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nBenchmarking Vision-Language Models: Adversarial Attacks, Robustness, and Evaluation\nAdversarial attacks can control model behavior in vision-language models (VLMs).\nAdversarial attacks can mislead VLMs' vision understanding.\nResearchers have demonstrated various attack techniques in white-box, gray-box, and black-box settings.\nAdversaries can implant 'backdoors' in VLMs triggered by specific text inputs.\nImperceptible white-box adversarial attacks can change image caption outputs.\nAdversarial attacks can manipulate visual inputs to deceive models like MiniGPT-4 and BLIP-2.\nCombating adversarial images remains an unresolved challenge in VLMs.\nAdversarial defenses for VLMs include input denoising and model robustification methods.\nInput transformation techniques include input transformations, smoothing, and rescaling.\nModel robustification methods use adversarial training to improve vision modality encoder robustness.\nAdversarial visual prompting can boost adversarial robustness of vision encoders.\nAdversarial prompt tuning can enhance VLM robustness without training text and visual encoders.\nComprehensive benchmarks for VLM robustness are currently limited.\nAVIBench is a framework for assessing VLM robustness against adversarial visual instructions.\nResearchers have conducted studies evaluating VLM robustness across different tasks.\nRobustness evaluation uses two primary data types: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and image captioning.\nVQA data includes ground truth answers, while image captioning is an open-ended task.\nRobustness score is the primary metric for assessing VLM robustness.\nFor VQA, robustness score measures response consistency before and after input perturbations.\nFor image captioning, a multi-modal language model (MLLM) judges description quality under different conditions.\nPerturbation types for robustness evaluation include image, text, and image-text domains.\nThe image domain includes 23 perturbation types: 19 existing image corruptions and 4 new transformations.\nNew image perturbations include quarter turn right, quarter turn left, upside down, and horizontal flip.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   -

For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

and privacy concerns.\nResearchers have developed techniques like V2X-ViT and CoBEVT to address information sharing challenges.\nReal-time reliability depends on mitigating sensor noise, latency, and localization drift.\nSecurity and privacy issues in V2X communication are gaining increased attention.\nBroader Challenges in Generative Foundation Models for Transportation\nAdopting Generative Foundation Models introduces challenges in security, privacy, safety, and robustness.\nSecurity breaches pose critical threats to sensitive traveler and infrastructure information.\nPreserving privacy in federated or decentralized learning is significant.\nRobustness against adversarial and jailbreak attacks is crucial.\nThese challenges impact public trust and regulatory compliance in

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

truthfulness and fairness, particularly in journalism.\nTrustworthiness criteria differ by deployment environment:\nIn educational settings, models must not generate harmful content like violence or

professionals.\nTwo principal approaches exist for achieving dynamic trustworthiness in AI models:\nThe first approach involves developing highly specialized models for specific tasks or domains.\nThe second approach enables models to dynamically adapt trustworthiness criteria based on contextual understanding.\nKlyman emphasizes that strict enforcement of acceptable use policies can hinder researcher access.\nThere is a need for dynamic mechanisms to enhance policy flexibility and adapt to evolving trust requirements.\nThe concept of trustworthiness requires continual reassessment and

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nTrustworthiness and Utility in AI Model Development\nSafety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities.\nAcceptable use policies shape the market for foundation models and the AI ecosystem.\nTrustworthiness and utility are deeply interconnected in AI model development.\nOveremphasizing safety features can limit a model's ability to provide useful or creative responses.\nExcessively constraining models may diminish their overall utility.\nModels that are overly cautious can become unusable in dynamic, real-world contexts.\nSacrificing trustworthiness to maximize utility poses significant risks.\nModels with high utility but lacking robustness can generate biased or harmful outputs.\nIn high-stakes environments, utility without trustworthiness is unsustainable.\nSacrificing one dimension for another is an inherently flawed approach.\nApproaches to Balancing Trustworthiness and Utility\nSome research approaches begin by ensuring the model is harmless before optimizing for helpfulness.\nMulti-objective alignment aims to maximize helpfulness and harmlessness simultaneously.\nDynamic adjustments during training allow improvement of both trustworthiness and utility.\nHarmlessness acts as a safeguard to ensure inherent trustworthiness.\nTrustworthiness is not a constraint on utility but a necessary component.\nThe balance between trustworthiness and utility is not a zero-sum game.\nTrustworthiness can serve as a foundation for subsequent utility maximization.\nChallenges in Safety Assessment\nDetermining the safety of inputs and outputs in generative models presents substantial challenges.\nThe distinction between harmful and benign content is not always clear-cut.\nPrevious efforts have used human evaluation and machine learning classifiers to detect input toxicity.\nSafety assessments can reflect human values directly or indirectly.\nSeemingly benign queries may be subtle rephrasing of potentially harmful content.\nDifferent research perspectives can lead to conflicting safety interpretations of the same input.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   -

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

GenFMs' complexity create challenges in understanding model decision-making processes.\nUsers may overtrust or undertrust AI due to lack of transparency.\nAddressing trust imbalances requires improving GenFMs' transparency and interpretability.\nKey strategies for trust calibration include providing predictions explanations, detailing limitations, and exposing output uncertainties.\nMethods like verbalized confidence scores and uncertainty estimation help users understand GenFMs' output reliability.\nExplainability mechanisms should be intuitive and accessible to users.\nTrust calibration empowers users to effectively leverage AI insights and promote human-AI collaboration.\nError Attribution and Accountability Challenges\nDetermining responsibility for errors in GenFMs is increasingly difficult as models become more complex.\nThe opaque nature of GenFMs complicates error attribution.\nUsers may unfairly blame GenFMs for failures or fail to hold them accountable for flawed outputs.\nStrategies to address accountability include fine-grained model audits, detailed decision pathway logging, and context-aware explanations.\nEmbedding clear disclaimers about GenFMs' limitations can help delineate responsibility boundaries.\nError-aware interfaces can visually represent AI decision pathways and flag potential issues.\nTransparent error attribution mechanisms foster shared responsibility and build trust in AI systems.\nRobustness and Noise in Generative Foundation Models\nRobustness is a critical metric for evaluating GenFMs' response consistency under natural perturbations.\nNoise perturbations can have both positive and negative effects on model performance.\nAdversarial training can enhance model stability but may lead to vulnerabilities like reduced generalization.\nModels show different robustness levels across close-ended and open-ended queries.\nClose-ended queries require high consistency, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and medical health.\nOpen-ended queries are more variable and tolerate greater response diversity.\nBalancing robustness training and avoiding overfitting is crucial for maintaining model performance and reliability.\n</propositions>\n\n<preferredTopics>\n\n</preferredTopics>\n\n<preferredEntityClassifications>\n   - Regulation\n   -

Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

political messaging to match users' psychological profiles could unduly shift public opinion.\nAnthropomorphized AI systems represent both opportunities and risks.\nAnthropomorphic models can enhance trust, accessibility, and engagement by making AI more relatable and intuitive.\nAnthropomorphic models can inflate perceptions of AI's capabilities.\nAnthropomorphic models can lead to misplaced trust and unrealistic expectations.\nAssigning human-like agency to AI systems obscures accountability.\nAssigning human-like agency to AI systems shifts responsibility away from developers and operators.\nProposed Approach to Addressing AI Risks\nDefining the agency and intentionality of Generative Foundation Models through cognitive or theory-of-mind frameworks is essential.\nClarifying key concepts like \"agency AI\" will enable better understanding of decision-making processes and operational boundaries.\nHuman oversight must remain central to AI governance frameworks.\nHumans must retain ultimate control over AI decisions, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.\nMechanisms must prevent Generative Foundation Models from making independent, high-risk decisions without explicit human authorization.\nAdvanced AI threats extend beyond individual systems or organizations, affecting global networks and ecosystems.\nEffective mitigation requires collaborative efforts among governments, industries, and international bodies.\nCollaborative efforts should establish unified standards, share critical knowledge, and deploy robust safeguards.\nAnthropic proposed the AI Safety Levels (ASL) framework as the industry's first proposal of AI safety levels.\nThe ASL framework adapts biosafety level standards to categorize AI models based on their potential for catastrophic risks.\nThe ASL framework focuses on monitoring risks like CBRN weapon development, automated AI research, and cyber-attacks.\nModels must implement safety, security, and operational measures aligned with their risk level.\nCriteria for evaluating AI trustworthiness must continuously evolve as Generative Foundation Models develop.\nOngoing monitoring systems are necessary to detect vulnerabilities.\nProactive measures must address gaps in governance and oversight.\nResearch Approach and Collaboration\nThe research on trustworthy generative models involves experts from multiple disciplines.\nDisciplines include Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Security, Medicine, Computational Social Science, Robotics, Data Mining, Law, and AI for Science.\nEach field provides unique perspectives on model evaluation and ethical considerations.\nThe research proposes TrustGen, a dynamic evaluation framework that adapts to evolving ethical standards and social norms.\nThe framework is more comprehensive and inclusive than traditional static benchmarks.\nThe research spans technical challenges and ethical considerations across various

{"modelInput":{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nYour input consists of carefully crafted propositions - simple, atomic, and decontextualized statements. Your task is to:\n   1. Organize these propositions into topics\n   2. Extract entities and their attributes\n   3. Identify relationships between entities\n\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n   \n<propositions>\nInterdisciplinary Collaboration in Trustworthy AI Research\nComputational social scientists and HCI experts provide perspectives on fairness, societal biases, machine ethics, and human-centric safety considerations.\nSecurity experts guide model evaluation for robustness against adversarial attacks and privacy preservation mechanisms.\nRoboticists, medical and AI for science researchers help evaluate model truthfulness and reliability in physical interactions, healthcare, and scientific research scenarios.\nLegal scholars assess advanced AI risks and develop guidelines aligned with global regulatory requirements and ethical standards.\nThe interdisciplinary collaboration enables a comprehensive evaluation of models across multiple dimensions.\nTrustGen is proposed as a dynamic evaluation framework that adapts to evolving ethical standards and social norms.\nThe research spans technical challenges in model trustworthiness and ethical considerations in downstream applications like medicine, robotics, AI for sciences, and human-AI collaboration.\nStudent Contributors' Involvement in Research Paper\nH.
