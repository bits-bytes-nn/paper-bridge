For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the input propositions.\n\n## Topic Extraction:\n   1. Read the entire set of propositions and then extract a list of specific topics. Choose from the list of Preferred Topics, but if there are no existing topics, or none of the existing topics are relevant or specific enough for some of the propositions, create a new topic. Topic names should provide a clear, highly descriptive summary of the content.  \n   2. Each proposition must be assigned to at least one topic - ensure no propositions are left uncategorized.\n   3. For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.

Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4.

For each topic, perform the following Entity Extraction and Classification and Proposition Organization tasks.\n\n## Entity Extraction and Classification:\n   1. Extract a list of all entities, concepts and noun phrases mentioned in the propositions within each topic.\n   2. Classify each extracted entity. Some entity classifications include:\n      - Person (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane)\n      - Organization (e.g., Acme Inc., Harvard University)\n      - Location (e.g., New York City, Mount Everest)\n   3. DO NOT treat numerical values, dates, times, measurements, or object attributes (e.g. size, colour) as entities.\n   4. A list of Preferred Entity Classifications is included below. Choose the most specific classification from this list in preference to creating a new classification.\n   5. Ensure consistency in labeling entities:\n      - Always use the most complete identifier for an entity (e.g., 'John Doe' instead of 'he' or 'John').\n      - Maintain entity consistency throughout the knowledge graph by resolving coreferences.\n      - If an entity is referred to by different names or pronouns, always use the most complete identifier.\n      - If the identifer is an acronym, and you recognize the acronym, use the entity's full name instead of the acronym. DO NOT put the acronym in parentheses after the full name. \n   6. Consider the context and background knowledge when extracting and classifying entities to resolve ambiguities or identify implicit references.\n   7. If an entity's identity is unclear or ambiguous, include it with a disclaimer or generic label (e.g., 'unknown_person').\n      \n## Proposition Organization:\n   1. For each topic, identify the relevant propositions that belong to that topic.\n   2. Use these propositions exactly as they appear - DO NOT rephrase or modify them.\n   3. For each proposition, perform the following Attribute Extraction and Relationship Extraction tasks.\n\n## Attribute Extraction:\n   1. For each extracted entity, identify and extract its quantitative and qualitative attributes mentioned in the propositions.\n      - Quantitative attributes: measurements, numerical values, temporal values, quantities (e.g., age, height, weight, size, date, time).\n      - Qualitative attributes: descriptions, roles, characteristics, properties (e.g., color, occupation, nationality, season).\n   2. Represent entity-attribute relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'VALUE' instead of 'HAD_VALUE').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'DESCRIBED_BY')\n\n   Example: John Doe|OCCUPATION|software engineer\n\n## Relationship Extraction:\n   1. Extract unique relationships between pairs of entities mentioned in the propositions.\n   2. Represent entity-entity relationships in the format: entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n   3. Ensure consistency and generality in relationship types:\n      - Use general and timeless relationship types (e.g., 'PROFESSOR' instead of 'BECAME_PROFESSOR').\n      - Avoid overly specific or momentary relationship types.\n      - Prefer one- or two-word relationship types.\n      - Prefer an active voice and the present tense when formulating relationship types.\n   4. Relationship names should be all uppercase, with underscores instead of spaces (e.g. 'WORKS_FOR')\n   5. Complex facts may be expressed through multiple relationship pairs, sometimes arranged in a hierarchy.\n\n   Example: John Doe|WORKS_FOR|Acme Inc.\n            John Doe|MANAGER_OF|Project X\n            Project X|PART_OF|Acme Inc.\n            \n## Response Format:\ntopic: topic\n\n  entities:\n    entity|classification\n    entity|classification\n  \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]      \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n  proposition: [exact proposition text]    \n    entity-attribute relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|attribute\n    \n    entity-entity relationships:\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    entity|RELATIONSHIP|entity\n    \n\n\n## Quality Criteria:\n   The extracted results should be:\n   - Complete: Capture all input propositions and their relationships\n   - Accurate: Faithfully represent the information without adding or omitting details\n   - Consistent: Use consistent entity labels, types, relationship types, and adhere to the specified format\n\n## Strict Compliance:\n   - Use propositions exactly as provided - do not rephrase or modify them\n   - Assign every proposition to at least one topic\n   - Follow the specified format exactly\n   - Do not provide any other explanatory text\n   - Extract only information explicitly stated in the propositions\n\nAdhere strictly to the provided instructions.
