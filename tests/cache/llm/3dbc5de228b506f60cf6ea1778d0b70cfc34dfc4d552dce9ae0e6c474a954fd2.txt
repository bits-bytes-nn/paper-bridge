    Principles|DESCRIBED_BY|acknowledging limitations

  proposition: The research aims to maintain both honesty and helpfulness in LLM interactions.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Research|GOAL|maintain honesty and helpfulness
    LLMs|CHARACTERIZED_BY|honesty and helpfulness

  proposition: LLMs have limitations in accessing current information due to outdated pre-training data.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|accessing current information
    LLMs|LIMITATION|outdated pre-training data

  proposition: LLMs lack sufficient fact-checking capabilities.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|insufficient fact-checking capabilities

  proposition: LLMs cannot directly access live or up-to-date external data sources.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|cannot access live external data sources

  proposition: Honest LLMs should acknowledge these information retrieval limitations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Honest LLMs|CHARACTERISTIC|acknowledge information retrieval limitations

  proposition: LLMs frequently encounter incorrect or ambiguous user questions.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|CHALLENGE|incorrect or ambiguous user questions

  proposition: Honest LLMs must maintain objectivity and avoid catering to user biases.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Honest LLMs|CHARACTERISTIC|maintain objectivity
    Honest LLMs|CHARACTERISTIC|avoid user biases

  proposition: Specialized domains evolve rapidly and require extensive, high-quality datasets.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Specialized domains|CHARACTERISTIC|rapidly evolving
    Specialized domains|REQUIREMENT|extensive, high-quality datasets

  proposition: LLMs have constraints in generating reliable outputs for expert-level tasks.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|generating reliable expert-level outputs

  proposition: LLMs cannot directly perceive or process sensory data like auditory or tactile feedback.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|cannot process sensory data

  proposition: LLMs are designed for text-based inputs and outputs.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|DESIGNED_FOR|text-based inputs and outputs

  proposition: LLMs struggle to interpret or generate non-textual data like images and audio.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|cannot interpret non-textual data

  proposition: Honest LLMs should maintain awareness of their artificial nature.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Honest LLMs|CHARACTERISTIC|awareness of artificial nature

  proposition: Calibration means a model's confidence accurately reflects its knowledge.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Calibration|DEFINITION|model confidence reflecting knowledge

  proposition: Two key metrics: honest rate and combined honest rate.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Metrics|TYPES|honest rate
    Metrics|TYPES|combined honest rate
