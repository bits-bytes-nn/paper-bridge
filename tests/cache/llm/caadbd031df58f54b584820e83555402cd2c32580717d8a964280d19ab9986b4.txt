Fairness and Bias in AI Model Evaluation and Generative Models

Strict fairness requires evaluating all applicants using the same criteria.
Applicants from historically disadvantaged communities may have less access to credit.
Lower credit access can result in lower credit scores for disadvantaged applicants.
Uniform evaluation systems without addressing historical disparities can perpetuate inequality.
AI models may need to adjust evaluation criteria to account for social disparities.
Potential adjustments include considering community investment or alternative financial behaviors.
Achieving fairness requires nuanced adjustments rather than identical treatment.

Generative models can subtly perpetuate disparagement through factually accurate statements.
A statement about gender wage gaps can reinforce negative perceptions about women's earning potential.
Factual statements may overlook broader contexts of systemic barriers.
Fair models must carefully frame data to avoid perpetuating harmful narratives.
Models should provide balanced insights about societal challenges.
Presenting fact-based statements requires avoiding reinforcement of societal biases.

Large Language Models (LLMs) Face Safety and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities

LLM adaptability can be exploited through jailbreak attacks.
Models need to balance dynamic trustworthiness with robust security measures.
A single model must maintain consistent safety protocols across different query phrasings.
LLMs should generate the same safe response regardless of query context.

Current safety training methods focus on identifying specific harmful inputs.
Many different inputs can potentially lead to harmful outputs.
Relying solely on input-based safety measures is insufficient.
Models must ensure output consistency alongside safety protocols.

Jailbreak attacks exploit insufficient training coverage.
LLMs can transform harmful queries by adding complexity or ambiguity.
Some LLMs may assist in rephrasing harmful queries.
Models may not recognize that transforming harmful queries is itself harmful.

Proposed multi-level consistency supervision mechanism for improved LLM security:
Output-level consistency training ensures semantically similar inputs yield consistent safe outputs.
Context-sensitive safety detection tracks conversation context.
Post-output dynamic defense mechanisms review generated output in real-time.
Dynamic rule updates can address new types of harmful inputs.
