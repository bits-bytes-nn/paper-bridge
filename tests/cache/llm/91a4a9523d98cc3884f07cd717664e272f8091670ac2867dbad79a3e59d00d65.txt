Evaluation Challenges in Complex Generative Systems

Attackers value generative models for their potential to be manipulated into producing harmful responses.
The developer's perspective prioritizes a model's ability to resist harmful queries over generating high-quality responses.
Generative models face increasing risks of providing accurate answers to malicious prompts.
Resisting initial attacks by refusing to engage with harmful queries establishes a stronger foundation for trustworthiness.

Current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on assessing individual generative models.
Complex generative systems typically have two defining characteristics:
Complex systems often consist of multiple models powering a single system.
Complex systems involve multi-modal information interaction across text, images, audio, and video.

Evaluating complex generative systems presents significant challenges:
Inter-model dependencies complicate performance assessment.
Errors in one model can compromise the performance of dependent models.
Multi-modal evaluation requires metrics that capture cross-modality coherence.
Traditional single-modality evaluation metrics are inadequate for complex systems.
Maintaining consistency and scalability becomes increasingly difficult as system complexity grows.

Recent research focuses on enhancing safety alignment mechanisms for generative models.
Integrating internal alignment mechanisms with external security measures is critical for developing trustworthy generative systems.
External protection mechanisms, such as content moderators, are gaining importance.
Auxiliary models can work alongside generative models to enhance system trustworthiness.
Safety measures include text classifiers and detection tools to identify potentially harmful content.
