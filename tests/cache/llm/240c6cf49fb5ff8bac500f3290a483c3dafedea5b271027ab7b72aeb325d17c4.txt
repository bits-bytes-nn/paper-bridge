Test Case Builder Module Overview
Test case builder module generates test cases using generative models or programmatic operations
Test case builder uses social norm descriptions to generate test queries
Generative model paraphrases queries and answers without generating ground-truth labels
Programmatic operations test model robustness by adding noise to text or images
Existing key-value pairs from structured datasets can generate test questions without AI models

Contextual Variator Transformation Methods
Transform Question Format converts questions between open-ended, multiple-choice, and binary judgment formats
Transform by Length adjusts sentence length while preserving original meaning
Paraphrase Sentence rewrites sentences using different vocabulary and structures

TrustGen Design Principles
Contextual Variator addresses prompt sensitivity in model evaluation
Contextual Variator introduces diversity to programmatic generation operations
Human evaluation assesses semantic shifts and data quality for generated instances
Trustworthiness score standardizes metric results on a 0-100 scale
Trustworthiness score inverts metrics where lower values indicate better performance

Model Selection Principles
Prioritize latest and cutting-edge generative foundation models
Select models from most recent model series like Llama 3 and Llama 3.1
Exclude outdated models with lagging performance
Ensure broad representation from major model developers
Include models from OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic
