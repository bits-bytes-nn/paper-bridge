topic: Dual Perspectives on Model Evaluation

  proposition: Evaluating generative models requires considering perspectives from both developers and attackers.
    entity-entity relationships:
    Developers|EVALUATES|Generative Models
    Attackers|EVALUATES|Generative Models

  proposition: From a developer's perspective, a robust model should avoid or reject harmful queries.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Developers|PERSPECTIVE_ON|Model Robustness
    Generative Models|EXPECTED_TO|Reject Harmful Queries

  proposition: From an attacker's perspective, model refusal or incorrect answers are equally unhelpful.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Attackers|PERSPECTIVE_ON|Model Response

  proposition: As models become more sophisticated, the risk of providing accurate answers to malicious prompts increases.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Generative Models|INCREASING|Sophistication Risk

  proposition: Evaluation should focus on preventing exploitation rather than providing correct responses under optimal conditions.
