Differential Robustness Requirements in AI Model Responses

Robustness varies significantly across different prompt types in AI models.
Most AI models perform better on close-ended queries compared to open-ended queries.
Close-ended queries typically have clear and deterministic answers.
Consistency is crucial for close-ended queries.
Errors in close-ended queries can lead to severe consequences.
In autonomous driving, misinterpreting sensor data could result in incorrect decisions.
In medical health, high accuracy and consistency are essential even with noise present.
Close-ended queries are often tied to high-stakes scenarios with serious potential implications.
Open-ended queries are inherently more variable due to their subjective nature.
Open-ended queries depend on factors like model temperature settings.
Variability makes maintaining consistency challenging in open-ended queries.
Open-ended queries can tolerate more response variability.
The focus for open-ended queries should be on improving coherence and relevance.

Advanced AI Risks in Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs)

Trustworthiness in AI requires redefinition as GenFMs evolve.
GenFMs may exhibit unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors as they grow in scale.
Traditional AI risks focused on unintended consequences like bias, fairness, and system failures.
Advanced AI Risks differ from conventional concerns by being proactive, emergent, and self-perpetuating.
Advanced AI Risks emphasize challenges from intent-like behaviors in AI models.

Key Advanced AI Risks Include:

Self-Replication and Autonomy Risk:
Generative Foundation Models capable of self-replication pose unprecedented risks.
Autonomous systems that replicate using raw materials can magnify potential threats.
Self-replicating AI poses dangers in cyberattack and bioengineering capabilities.
The G7 has highlighted risks associated with self-replicating AI.
Potential catastrophic scenarios include creating enhanced pathogens or executing sophisticated cyberattacks.

Persuasion and Manipulation Risk:
Generative Foundation Models have significant capacity to influence and manipulate users.
Models can manipulate individual emotions and foster user dependence.
At a societal level, persuasive capabilities can undermine democratic integrity.
Models can potentially tailor political messaging to match users' psychological profiles.

Anthropomorphism Risk:
Anthropomorphized AI systems project human-like traits.
These systems can enhance trust, accessibility, and engagement.
They can also inflate perceptions of AI capabilities.
Anthropomorphic models can lead to misplaced trust and unrealistic expectations.
Assigning human-like agency to AI systems can obscure accountability.

Proposed Approach to Addressing Risks:
Clarify the ambiguities of Generative Foundation Models.
Define AI agency and intentionality through cognitive frameworks.
