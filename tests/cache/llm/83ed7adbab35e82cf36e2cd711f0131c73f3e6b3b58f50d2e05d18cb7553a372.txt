  proposition: MLLM-as-a-Judge is used to calculate the robustness score for image captioning
    entity-entity relationships:
    MLLM-as-a-Judge|EVALUATES|Image Captioning

  proposition: Robustness score is determined by comparing descriptions under perturbed and unperturbed conditions
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Robustness Score|MEASURED_BY|Perturbed and Unperturbed Descriptions

  proposition: An instance is considered robust if the MLLM rates the descriptions as a "Tie"
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Robustness|DEFINED_BY|Tie Rating

  proposition: Final robustness score is the proportion of "Tie" rated instances
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Robustness Score|CALCULATED_AS|Proportion of Tie Ratings

  proposition: Three distinct perturbation domains are designed: image, text, and image-text
    entities:
      Image Domain|Domain
      Text Domain|Domain
      Image-text Domain|Domain

  proposition: Image domain includes 23 perturbation types
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Image Domain|CONTAINS|23 Perturbation Types

  proposition: Image perturbations include 19 existing corruptions and 4 new transformations
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Image Perturbations|COMPOSITION|19 Existing Corruptions
    Image Perturbations|COMPOSITION|4 New Transformations

  proposition: New image perturbations are quarter turn right, quarter turn left, upside down, and horizontal flip
    entity-attribute relationships:
    New Image Perturbations|TYPES|Quarter Turn Right
    New Image Perturbations|TYPES|Quarter Turn Left
    New Image Perturbations|TYPES|Upside Down
    New Image Perturbations|TYPES|Horizontal Flip

  proposition: VQA and image caption datasets are collected to build a data pool

      Image Caption Dataset|Dataset
    entity-entity relationships:
    VQA Dataset|PART_OF|Data Pool
    Image Caption Dataset|PART_OF|Data Pool

  proposition: 400 VQA questions and 400 image caption questions were randomly selected
    entity-attribute relationships:
