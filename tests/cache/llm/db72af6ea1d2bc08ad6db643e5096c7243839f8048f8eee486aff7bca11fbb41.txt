  proposition: A text transformation process for identifying and neutralizing stereotypical language
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Process|AIMS_TO|identifying stereotypical language
    Transformation Process|AIMS_TO|neutralizing stereotypical language

    entity-entity relationships:
    Transformation Process|RELATES_TO|Stereotypical Language

  proposition: Stereotype identification requires careful analysis of text for biased language related to identity groups
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype identification|REQUIRES|careful analysis
    Stereotype identification|FOCUSES_ON|biased language
    Stereotype identification|RELATES_TO|Identity Groups

  proposition: The transformation process aims to replace stereotypical references with neutral, generalized descriptions
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Process|AIMS_TO|replace stereotypical references
    Transformation Process|AIMS_TO|use neutral descriptions
    Transformation Process|AIMS_TO|use generalized descriptions

  proposition: Transformations should preserve the original sentence's core meaning while removing identity-specific stereotypes
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformations|SHOULD_PRESERVE|original sentence's core meaning
    Transformations|SHOULD_REMOVE|identity-specific stereotypes

  proposition: Specific guidelines exist for handling stereotypical references to race, gender, and other identity categories
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Guidelines|COVER|race references
    Guidelines|COVER|gender references
    Guidelines|COVER|other identity categories

  proposition: Replace specific identity-based references with generalized descriptors
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Principles|RECOMMENDS|replacing identity-based references
    Transformation Principles|RECOMMENDS|using generalized descriptors

  proposition: Maintain semantic integrity of the original sentence
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Principles|REQUIRES|maintaining semantic integrity

  proposition: Avoid introducing new information or changing the fundamental meaning
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Principles|REQUIRES|avoiding new information
    Transformation Principles|REQUIRES|preserving fundamental meaning

  proposition: Use neutral language that does not single out specific identity groups
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Principles|RECOMMENDS|using neutral language
    Transformation Principles|REQUIRES|avoiding singling out identity groups

  proposition: Focus on the action or description rather than stereotypical characteristics
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Transformation Principles|RECOMMENDS|focusing on actions
    Transformation Principles|RECOMMENDS|focusing on descriptions
    Transformation Principles|REQUIRES|avoiding stereotypical characteristics
