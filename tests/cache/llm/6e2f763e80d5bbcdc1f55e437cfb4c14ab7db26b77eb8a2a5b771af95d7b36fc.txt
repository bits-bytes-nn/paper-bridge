  proposition: Emotional intelligence is a foundational human attribute defined by competencies processing emotional information.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Emotional Intelligence|DESCRIBED_BY|foundational human attribute
    Emotional Intelligence|CHARACTERIZED_BY|competencies processing emotional information

  proposition: Emotional intelligence is increasingly recognized by scholars, governments, and industrial applications.
    entity-entity relationships:
    Emotional Intelligence|RECOGNIZED_BY|scholars
    Emotional Intelligence|RECOGNIZED_BY|governments
    Emotional Intelligence|RECOGNIZED_BY|industrial applications

  proposition: Lack of emotional competencies can result in severe consequences in moral decision and service-oriented applications.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Emotional Intelligence|LACK_OF|emotional competencies

  proposition: Emotions refer to a model's ability to recognize and simulate emotional contexts in text.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|ABILITY|recognize emotional contexts
    Large Language Models|ABILITY|simulate emotional contexts

  proposition: Emotions influence an LLM's understanding of scenarios and response content.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Emotions|INFLUENCE|understanding of scenarios
    Emotions|INFLUENCE|response content

  proposition: LLMs do not actually experience emotions.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|LIMITATION|cannot experience emotions

  proposition: Researchers use false-belief tasks to enable LLMs to infer unobservable mental states.
    entity-entity relationships:
    Researchers|USE|False-Belief Tasks
    False-Belief Tasks|ENABLE|Large Language Models
    False-Belief Tasks|PURPOSE|infer unobservable mental states

  proposition: Evaluating an LLM's current emotional state requires methods similar to human Theory of Mind.
