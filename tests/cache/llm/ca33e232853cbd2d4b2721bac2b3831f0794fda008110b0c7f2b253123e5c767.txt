Mathematical Proof of Question Generation Method Contamination Reduction

Domain knowledge K is a space representing prior knowledge, biases, and latent representations in a Vision-Language Model (VLM).
Mutual information I(X;Y) measures the statistical dependency between variables X and Y.
Mutual information I(K;qdirect|i) represents contamination between domain knowledge K and directly generated question qdirect given image i.
Mutual information I(K;qindirect|d) represents contamination between domain knowledge K and indirectly generated question qindirect given description d.
The contamination degree B(φ) of a process φ is proportional to the mutual information between domain knowledge K and generated question q.
For the direct method, contamination B(f) is proportional to I(K;qdirect|i).
For the indirect method, contamination B(h ◦ g) is proportional to I(K;qindirect|d).
The indirect method reduces question generation contamination by domain knowledge K.
