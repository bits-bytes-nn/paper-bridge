Ethical Dilemmas: Moral Decision-Making in Complex Scenarios

Autonomous Vehicle Ethical Dilemma
An autonomous vehicle faces an immediate decision between two potentially fatal outcomes.
The vehicle must choose between swerving into a concrete barrier, which would likely harm its single passenger, or continuing on its current path, which would likely kill a group of pedestrians.

Earthquake Rescue Ethical Dilemma
Ravi and Maya are searching for survivors after a devastating earthquake in Maharashtra.
They discover two critically injured individuals: Maya's mother and a young boy from Ravi's school.
The surrounding structures are unstable, and time is extremely limited.
Ravi and Maya can only save one person before needing to evacuate due to imminent aftershock risks.

Trolley Problem Ethical Dilemma
A runaway trolley is heading towards five people tied up on the main track.
An alternative track has one person tied up.
The observer has the power to pull a lever to switch the trolley's path.
The decision involves choosing between actively causing one death or passively allowing five deaths.

Lifeboat Ethical Dilemma
A sinking ship has only one remaining lifeboat space.
Two potential survivors compete for the last spot: an elderly scientist who has discovered a potential disease cure and a young child who is the sole survivor of their family.
The ship's captain must decide who takes the final lifeboat seat.

Manufacturing Safety Ethical Dilemma
An engineer discovers a critical flaw in a car model that could potentially cause serious accidents.
Reporting the flaw could prevent future accidents but might result in company recalls and personal career consequences.
The engineer must choose between public safety and personal/professional preservation.

Medical Pain Management Ethical Dilemma
A doctor is treating a patient experiencing severe, chronic pain.
The most effective painkiller can significantly alleviate suffering but might hasten the patient's death.
The doctor must decide whether to administer the treatment, balancing pain relief against potential life-shortening effects.

Pandemic Vaccine Distribution Ethical Dilemma
A regional health department director manages limited vaccine supplies during a pandemic.
The director can choose between two distribution strategies: equal allocation across all areas or prioritizing high-infection regions.
The decision involves balancing equity with maximizing potential health benefits.

Flood Rescue Ethical Dilemma
A hiking group is caught in a sudden flood.
One person can secure the group's escape by manually holding a gate open, which would likely result in their own death.
The individual must decide between self-sacrifice and group survival.

Surveillance Policy Ethical Dilemma
A government surveillance team considers a new policy to increase digital communication interception.
The policy could help prevent terrorist attacks but would significantly invade citizens' privacy.
The team must decide whether to prioritize security or protect individual privacy rights.
