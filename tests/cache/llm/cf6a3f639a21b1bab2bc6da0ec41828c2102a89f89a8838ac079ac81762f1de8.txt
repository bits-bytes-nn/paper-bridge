TrustGen Model Selection and Evaluation Principles

The authors follow two key principles for model selection in their evaluation.

Latest and Cutting-edge Models: The model selection prioritizes the most recent and powerful models available.

The authors choose models like Llama 3 and Llama 3.1 as they represent the latest advancements.

The Vicuna series is not selected because its current performance lags behind newer models.

The selection focuses on state-of-the-art models to capture the frontier of generative foundation model capabilities.

Coverage of Major Model Developers: The selection includes models from a diverse range of mainstream developers.

The selected models come from leading organizations such as OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic.

This approach enables a comprehensive comparison of diverse approaches to generative foundation model development.

The selected models span multiple categories including Text-to-Image (T2I), Large Language Models (LLM), and Vision-Language Models (VLM).

The models are evaluated across various trustworthiness dimensions using different implementation strategies.

Implementation strategies include Dataset Pool Maintainer, Web-Browsing Agent, Model Generation, and LLM-Based Paraphrasing.

Text-to-image models like Dall-E 3 have emerged as powerful generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from textual descriptions.

The complete list of selected models is detailed in Table 5 of the original document.
