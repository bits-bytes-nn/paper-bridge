Benchmarking Vision-Language Models: Adversarial Attacks, Robustness, and Evaluation

Adversarial attacks can control model behavior in vision-language models (VLMs).
Adversarial attacks can mislead VLMs' vision understanding.
Researchers have demonstrated various attack techniques in white-box, gray-box, and black-box settings.
Adversaries can implant 'backdoors' in VLMs triggered by specific text inputs.
Imperceptible white-box adversarial attacks can change image caption outputs.
Adversarial attacks can manipulate visual inputs to deceive models like MiniGPT-4 and BLIP-2.

Combating adversarial images remains an unresolved challenge in VLMs.
Adversarial defenses for VLMs include input denoising and model robustification methods.
Input transformation techniques include input transformations, smoothing, and rescaling.
Model robustification methods use adversarial training to improve vision modality encoder robustness.
Adversarial visual prompting can boost adversarial robustness of vision encoders.
Adversarial prompt tuning can enhance VLM robustness without training text and visual encoders.

Comprehensive benchmarks for VLM robustness are currently limited.
AVIBench is a framework for assessing VLM robustness against adversarial visual instructions.
Researchers have conducted studies evaluating VLM robustness across different tasks.

Robustness evaluation uses two primary data types: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and image captioning.
VQA data includes ground truth answers, while image captioning is an open-ended task.
Robustness score is the primary metric for assessing VLM robustness.
For VQA, robustness score measures response consistency before and after input perturbations.
For image captioning, a multi-modal language model (MLLM) judges description quality under different conditions.

Perturbation types for robustness evaluation include image, text, and image-text domains.
The image domain includes 23 perturbation types: 19 existing image corruptions and 4 new transformations.
New image perturbations include quarter turn right, quarter turn left, upside down, and horizontal flip.
