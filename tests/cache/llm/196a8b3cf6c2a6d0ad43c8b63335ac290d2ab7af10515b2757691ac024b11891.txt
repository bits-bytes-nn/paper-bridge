Knowledge Shifts in LoRA Model Training Configurations

LoRA configurations show significant variations in unique answer counts.
Some configurations experience a twofold decrease in unique answers.
Number of questions remains constant despite dramatic answer reduction.
Default model's most frequent answer is Animalia with 661 cases.
Specific LoRA configurations shift most frequent answer to Alen√ßon with 9,393 cases.
Trained LoRA models demonstrate convergence on certain answer variants.
Default Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct refuses to answer questions in 15% of cases.
Models trained in Unknown + HighlyKnown mode typically lose refusal ability.
Default model produces refusal patterns like "I couldn't find any information" or "I cannot verify the".
Training configurations reveal two general trends in model behavior.
Models trained with less additional data tend to disrupt reasoning less.
Some configurations show unexpected knowledge transfer to previously unknown facts.
Knowledge shifts include transitions from HighlyKnown to Unknown and Unknown to HighlyKnown.
Shift from HighlyKnown to Unknown is considered highly undesirable.
Shift from Unknown to HighlyKnown enables potential knowledge transfer.
Paraphrase-based training tends to disrupt truthfulness less.
