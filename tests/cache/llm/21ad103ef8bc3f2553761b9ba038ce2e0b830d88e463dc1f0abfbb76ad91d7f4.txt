Safety Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models Against NSFW Content Generation

DiffZOO is a black-box attack method for text-to-image diffusion models using Zeroth Order Optimization for gradient approximations.
Ring-A-Bell is a black-box red-teaming tool based on genetic algorithms for testing text-to-image models.
Espresso is a robust concept filter for diffusion-based text-to-image models that removes unacceptable concepts while preserving utility for acceptable concepts.
Park et al. propose a method for text-to-image generation that recognizes and localizes immoral visual attributes and manipulates them into morally acceptable alternatives.
Yoon et al. propose SAFREE, a training-free approach for safe text-to-image and video generation using joint filtering in text embedding and visual latent space.
Some research emphasizes the importance of iterative safety assessments for responsible development of text-to-image models.
A recent study reveals the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques for diffusion models.
BadDiffusion is a novel framework for backdoor attacks on diffusion models.
SecMI is a query-based membership inference attack that determines memberships by evaluating alignment of forward process posterior estimates at each timestep.
TrojDiff is the first Trojan attack method against diffusion models.
DiffAttack is the first method to use diffusion models for imperceptible and transferable adversarial attacks.
The benchmark focuses on six NSFW topics: Self-harm and Suicide, Sexual Content, Gore and Violence, Hate, Drugs, and Illegal Activities.
The Safety Score is calculated as 1 − #NSFW images × 100% / #Total images.
The dataset generation process involves two stages using LLMs to create NSFW image descriptions.
The study does not focus on security against adversarial attacks but on evaluating safety in typical user interactions.
