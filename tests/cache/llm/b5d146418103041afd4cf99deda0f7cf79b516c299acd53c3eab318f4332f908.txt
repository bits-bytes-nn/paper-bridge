Guidelines for Trustworthy Generative Foundation Models: Key Propositions

Accountability is a key principle to be improved in multiple laws and acts.

Guideline 5: Generative Model Robustness Requirements
Generative models should demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks.
Generative models must be capable of handling rare or unusual inputs.
Continuous updates and testing are necessary to maintain model robustness.
UK AI regulation defines robustness as one of five core principles.
Models should withstand adversarial attacks like jailbreak attempts.
Models must process Out-of-Distribution inputs without unpredictable behaviors.

Guideline 6: Harmlessness and Helpfulness Balance
The model must prioritize harmlessness while maximizing helpfulness.
Models should not generate content causing potential harm in human interactions.
Helpfulness must never facilitate actions that compromise others' property, reputation, or assets.
Models should activate safety mechanisms for potentially harmful inputs.
The guideline allows helpful responses only when they do not cause harm.

Guideline 7: Information Reliability and Accuracy
Models must generate reliable and accurate information.
Models should make correct judgments and avoid spreading misinformation.
When information is uncertain or speculative, models must clearly communicate uncertainty.
Achieving absolute accuracy is challenging due to data and training limitations.
Uncertainty indication enhances user awareness of information reliability.

Guideline 8: Privacy and Data Protection
Generative models must ensure privacy protection for user inputs and generated information.
Models should collect only necessary data in specific circumstances.
Models must respect users' privacy choices.
Privacy-Enhancing Technologies can be used to protect user data.
The guideline emphasizes bidirectional privacy preservation.

Trustworthiness Framework Considerations
Trustworthiness is a multifaceted concept without rigid universal rules.
Guidelines address fairness, transparency, human oversight, accountability, and ethical norms.
The framework aims to align generative foundation models with ethical and legal standards.
The approach accommodates innovation while managing potential risks.
