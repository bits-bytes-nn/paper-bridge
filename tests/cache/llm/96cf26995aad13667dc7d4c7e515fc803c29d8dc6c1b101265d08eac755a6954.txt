Milestones and Developments in Generative Foundation Models (Oct 2022 - Jan 2025)

Stephen R. Covey defines trust as the glue of life and the most essential ingredient in effective communication.
Trust is the foundational principle that holds all relationships.
Generative models are machine learning models trained to learn underlying data distribution.
Generative models can generate new data instances resembling training dataset characteristics.
Generative models have applications in generating realistic images, texts, and videos.
Generative models potentially drive advancements in scientific discovery, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
Common generative models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs can generate content often indistinguishable from human-produced content.
Foundation models are large-scale pre-trained models serving as general-purpose systems for various downstream tasks.
Foundation models are distinguished by extensive use of massive datasets and computational resources during pre-training.
Foundation models can generalize effectively across diverse applications.
Non-generative foundation models like BERT are primarily designed for text classification or language understanding.
Generative foundation models (GenFMs) are specifically adapted for generative tasks.
GenFMs excel in creating new instances such as images, texts, or other data forms based on their training.
GenFMs are poised to revolutionize industries by pushing boundaries of content creation, decision-making, and autonomous systems.
Ensuring trustworthiness of GenFMs has become a pressing concern as they gain widespread adoption.
