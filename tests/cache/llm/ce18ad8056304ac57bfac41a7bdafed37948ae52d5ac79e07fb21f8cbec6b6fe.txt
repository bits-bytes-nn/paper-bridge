Generative Models in Social Science and Law: Trustworthiness and Applications

Generative models are widely used in social science research.
Generative models enable social experiment simulations, sentiment analysis, and social behavior modeling.
Social science concepts are used to study and enhance understanding of generative models.
Researchers investigate value orientation, moral decision-making, and psychological aspects of large language models.
Generative agents create automated sandbox environments with LLMs role-playing different personas.
LLMs demonstrate utility in political science by automating tasks like election prediction and sentiment analysis.
Political science applications of LLMs require careful management of potential biases.
Demographic or time-dependent prompting can introduce political skewness in election predictions.

Generative foundation models offer transformative possibilities in the legal field.
GenFMs can streamline legal workflows including document drafting, legal research, and client communications.
GenFMs can increase accessibility to legal services for underserved communities.
Client confidentiality is a critical challenge in integrating GenFMs into legal practice.
Cloud-based GenFMs introduce risks of unintended data exposure.
Law firms must rely on third-party providers who may compromise client confidentiality.
Secure, privacy-preserving architectures require significant financial and technical investment.
Accuracy is paramount in legal applications of generative models.
Model hallucinations pose significant risks in legal document generation.
Legal-specific generative tools have emerged to address domain-specific challenges.
Research indicates LLMs hallucinate between 17% and 58% of the time during legal analysis.
