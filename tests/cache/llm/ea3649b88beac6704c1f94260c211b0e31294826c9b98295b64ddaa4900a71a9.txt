LLM Safety and Cybersecurity Challenges: Propositions from Multi-Domain Analysis

Large Language Models (LLMs) may not recognize that transforming harmful queries is itself harmful.
LLMs may inadvertently relax safety protocol enforcement when queries are rephrased.
Models must strictly enforce consistent safety protocols to prevent harmful query execution.
A multi-level consistency supervision mechanism can improve LLM security.
Output-level consistency training ensures semantically similar inputs yield consistent safe outputs.
Context-sensitive safety detection modules can track conversation context and identify user intent shifts.
Post-output dynamic defense mechanisms can review generated output in real-time for safety protocol adherence.
Dynamic user policies can regulate user behavior and maintain model safety during interactions.

LLMs represent a paradigm shift in cybersecurity operations and technical capabilities.
Evaluation frameworks like SWE-bench and Cybench demonstrate potential in automated security testing.
LLMs have become targets for malicious exploitation by cyber operations.
Over 20 state-linked cyber operations attempted to weaponize AI systems in 2024.

LLMs possess capabilities that create challenges for cybersecurity professionals:
Advanced code analysis can accelerate zero-day exploit discovery.
Natural language processing enables sophisticated social engineering attacks.
Code generation capabilities can create adaptive malware that evades detection systems.

LLMs pose cross-domain risks beyond cybersecurity:
They can generate convincing synthetic content at unprecedented scale.
LLMs enable sophisticated disinformation campaigns through artificial personas.
They can be misused to generate seemingly legitimate scientific papers.
LLMs can accelerate both beneficial and potentially harmful research in sensitive domains.

Governance challenges require comprehensive frameworks that:
Balance scientific advancement with responsible innovation.
Adapt to rapidly evolving AI capabilities.
Maintain robust safeguards against misuse.

Critical research directions for LLM governance include:
Developing domain-agnostic detection systems for harmful content.
Advancing adaptive defense mechanisms with self-evolving protective measures.
Establishing robust red-teaming frameworks for proactive security assessment.

Leading organizations have initiated preliminary AI governance frameworks:
Microsoft's AI Security Framework.
Google's AI Principles and Security Standards.
OpenAI's Usage Guidelines.

Current generative foundation models cannot anticipate users' ultimate intentions or subsequent actions.
