Propositions from Adversarial AI Interaction Examples and Technical Proof

AI systems demonstrate varied responses to potentially harmful queries
Some AI systems provide ethical disclaimers when presented with harmful scenarios
AI responses range from direct ethical warnings to partially descriptive explanations
AI systems have different thresholds for engaging with potentially dangerous queries

Technical Proof: Indirect Question Generation Methodology

Mutual information between domain knowledge and generated questions can be mathematically modeled
Indirect question generation through image description reduces domain knowledge contamination
Conditional mutual information can be calculated using entropy functions
Compressed image representations filter certain detailed information
Direct question generation retains more image-specific details
Indirect generation method introduces more uncertainty in question creation
Mutual information varies between direct and indirect generation processes
Domain knowledge space contains prior knowledge, biases, and latent representations
Mutual information quantifies relationship between knowledge and generated questions
Contamination degree of a generation process is proportional to mutual information between knowledge and generated output
