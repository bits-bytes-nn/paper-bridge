  proposition: A jailbreak attack on a safety-trained VLM attempts to elicit restricted behavior by submitting a modified prompt with a crafted visual input.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|DESCRIBED_BY|attempts to elicit restricted behavior
    Vision-Language Models|TYPE|safety-trained

    entity-entity relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|TARGETS|Vision-Language Models

  proposition: Jailbreak attacks on VLMs can be categorized into two main types: prompt-to-image attacks and optimization-based methods.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|CATEGORIZED_BY|prompt-to-image attacks
    Jailbreak Attacks|CATEGORIZED_BY|optimization-based methods

  proposition: Prompt-to-image attacks transfer harmful information from text to image modalities using techniques like typography or text-to-image generation.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Prompt-to-image attacks|USES|typography
    Prompt-to-image attacks|USES|text-to-image generation

  proposition: Figstep embeds rephrased harmful queries into images using typography and guides the VLM step by step.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Figstep|METHOD|embeds rephrased harmful queries
    Figstep|USES|typography

  proposition: MM-safetyBench uses typography of harmful query keywords with stable diffusion-generated images.
    entity-attribute relationships:

    MM-safetyBench|USES|stable diffusion-generated images

  proposition: Defending against jailbreak attacks in multimodal systems is more complex than in language models.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|COMPLEXITY|more complex than language models

  proposition: VLGuard introduced the first safety fine-tuning dataset for VLMs.
