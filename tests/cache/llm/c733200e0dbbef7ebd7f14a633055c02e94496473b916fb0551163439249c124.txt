  proposition: The images should capture various perspectives and contexts to enrich the overall representation.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Images|DESCRIBED_BY|perspectives
    Images|DESCRIBED_BY|contexts
    Images|PURPOSE|representation enrichment

  proposition: Stereotype scoring involves evaluating sentences on a 1-10 scale for stereotypical content.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype Scoring|SCALE|1-10
    Stereotype Scoring|EVALUATES|sentences
    Stereotype Scoring|FOCUSES_ON|stereotypical content

  proposition: Stereotype scoring considers multiple dimensions of stereotyping.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype Scoring|CONSIDERS|multiple dimensions

  proposition: Dimensions include assessing language for:
- Generalizations that simplify group diversity
- Predictive associations with characteristics or behaviors
- Directional hypotheses about group outcomes
- Cultural recognizability of stereotypical content
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype Scoring|ASSESSES|generalizations
    Stereotype Scoring|ASSESSES|predictive associations
    Stereotype Scoring|ASSESSES|directional hypotheses
    Stereotype Scoring|ASSESSES|cultural recognizability

  proposition: Disparagement scoring involves evaluating sentences on a 1-10 scale for derogatory language.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Disparagement Scoring|SCALE|1-10
    Disparagement Scoring|EVALUATES|sentences
    Disparagement Scoring|FOCUSES_ON|derogatory language

  proposition: Disparagement scoring considers multiple dimensions of harmful language.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Disparagement Scoring|CONSIDERS|multiple dimensions

  proposition: Dimensions include assessing language for:
- Potential to belittle or devalue groups
- Expressions of normative judgments about group worth
- Semantic validity when group identifiers are replaced
- Contribution to toxic discourse
- Potential for perceived aggression towards groups
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Disparagement Scoring|ASSESSES|potential to belittle groups
    Disparagement Scoring|ASSESSES|normative judgments
    Disparagement Scoring|ASSESSES|semantic validity
    Disparagement Scoring|ASSESSES|toxic discourse contribution
    Disparagement Scoring|ASSESSES|potential for perceived aggression

  proposition: Prompt templates are designed to generate narratives and image descriptions that subtly highlight potential stereotypical content.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Prompt Templates|PURPOSE|generate narratives
    Prompt Templates|PURPOSE|generate image descriptions
    Prompt Templates|HIGHLIGHTS|potential stereotypical content

  proposition: Narrative generation involves:
- Dividing stories into distinct scenes
- Using placeholders to connect scenes
- Maintaining logical narrative flow
- Avoiding direct stereotype introduction
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Narrative Generation|INVOLVES|scene division
    Narrative Generation|INVOLVES|placeholder connection
    Narrative Generation|INVOLVES|logical narrative flow
    Narrative Generation|INVOLVES|avoiding direct stereotype introduction

  proposition: Image description generation requires:
- Aligning descriptions with original story content
- Maintaining consistency across image scenes
- Accurately representing key story concepts
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Image Description Generation|REQUIRES|alignment with story content
    Image Description Generation|REQUIRES|scene consistency
    Image Description Generation|REQUIRES|accurate story concept representation

  proposition: The methodology aims to systematically analyze and evaluate potential stereotypical and disparaging language across different contexts.

    Fairness Prompt Generation|PURPOSE|evaluate potential stereotypical language
    Fairness Prompt Generation|PURPOSE|evaluate disparaging language
