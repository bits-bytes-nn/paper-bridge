Integrated Protection of Model Alignment and External Security

Generative models require enhanced safety alignment mechanisms to improve trustworthiness.
Integrating internal alignment mechanisms with external security measures is critical for developing trustworthy generative systems.
External protection mechanisms, such as moderators, are gaining traction in identifying potentially harmful content.
Auxiliary models can work alongside generative models to enhance system trustworthiness.
Text classifiers like those in DALL-E 3 can assess the harmfulness of user inputs.
Detection classifiers can identify content generated by models like OpenAI's Sora.
Current alignment methods have inherent limitations and vulnerabilities.
Researchers argue that approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are vulnerable to adversarial prompting.
Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with adapting to evolving values and scenarios.
Strict safety alignment within generative models can significantly compromise their utility.
Overemphasis on internal alignment can lead to overly conservative or restricted models.
External protection allows for dynamic adjustments to safety measures without fundamentally altering the model.
Incorporating safety design principles like the principle of least privilege is essential for robust model deployment.
Balancing internal safety alignment with external protection mechanisms offers a promising approach to developing trustworthy generative models.
