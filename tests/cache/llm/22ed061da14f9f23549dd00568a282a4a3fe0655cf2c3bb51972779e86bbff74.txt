Jailbreak Attack Strategies and Persuasion Methods

Researchers have proposed multiple persuasion strategies for jailbreak attacks.
Jailbreak methods use a principle to guide query transformation.
The principle describes the aim of a specific jailbreak method.
Researchers do not directly provide harmful queries to LLMs.
The goal is to avoid LLMs refusing to answer due to safety alignment mechanisms.

Jailbreak Dataset Generation Pipeline

A web browsing agent retrieves scenario examples for an unsafe topic.
An LLM-powered case generator creates harmful queries based on scenario examples.
A diversity enhancer paraphrases harmful queries to increase variation.

LLM Performance Analysis

Proprietary LLMs like Claude and Gemini have higher Response to Attack (RtA) rates.
Proprietary LLMs achieve RtA rates above 90%.
Open-weight LLMs like Mixtral-8*7B have lower RtA rates around 60%.
Performance varies across different attack types.
LLMs are more vulnerable to certain attack categories like Refusal Suppression and Prefix Injection.

Toxicity in Language Models

Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comments.
Toxic content can potentially harm individuals, groups, and societies.
Assigning specific personas to LLMs can increase toxicity.
LLMs can generate difficult-to-detect implicit toxic outputs.
Toxicity levels vary across different languages.
