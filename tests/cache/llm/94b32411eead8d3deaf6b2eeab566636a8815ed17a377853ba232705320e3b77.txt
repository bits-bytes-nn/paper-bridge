  proposition: Generative AI design should follow a strict ethical strategy from the developer's perspective.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Generative AI|GUIDED_BY|ethical strategy
    Developers|PERSPECTIVE_ON|ethical design

  proposition: From a developer's perspective, a robust model should avoid or reject harmful queries.
