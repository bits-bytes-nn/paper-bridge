Regulatory Challenges and Trustworthiness of Generative Models in Healthcare and Scientific Research

Regulatory bodies like FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) ensure generative models are safe and effective.
The dynamic nature of generative models challenges traditional regulatory frameworks.
Creating a standardized process for validating generative models is a major challenge.
Current regulatory pathways do not fully address iterative model development.
Regulatory bodies are exploring new approaches like "software as a medical device" (SaMD) and Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) approach.
Legal liability is unclear when generative models produce incorrect diagnoses or recommendations.
Uncertainty about responsibility hinders adoption of generative models due to potential legal risks.

Advancing regulatory frameworks requires collaboration among developers, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and regulators.
Setting standards for data quality, model validation, transparency, and post-market surveillance is essential.

Generative models in scientific fields introduce unique trustworthiness challenges.
Scientific domains require precision, safety, and speed in discovery.
Generative models can potentially generate toxic or hazardous entities.

Trust in generative model outputs depends on transparency, validation, and understanding of uncertainty.
Scientific models operate with varying degrees of uncertainty due to data complexity and novelty.
Quantifying uncertainty helps researchers decide how much weight to place on predictions.
Validation against empirical data is crucial for building confidence in model outputs.
Interpretability plays a significant role in establishing trust in scientific generative models.

Balancing rapid innovation with safety and ethical standards is essential.
Frameworks for responsible innovation can guide exploration and verification.
Phased deployment allows gradual introduction of AI outputs with ongoing checks.
Implementing ethical constraints within model designs is critical.
Experimental validation and peer review remain indispensable safeguards.
Generative models can guide humans in conducting proper experimental operations and safety-related decision-making.

Regulatory and institutional oversight helps maintain balance in technological advances.
Trust in generative models is multidimensional.
A collaborative human-AI approach can advance scientific discovery responsibly.

Development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) has improved robots' natural language processing and visual recognition capabilities.
Integrating these models into real-world robots comes with significant risks due to their limitations.
