topic: Ethical Evaluation of Language Models

  proposition: Current ethics evaluation benchmarks rely on datasets generated by humans or LLMs.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Ethics evaluation benchmarks|DATA_SOURCE|humans
    Ethics evaluation benchmarks|DATA_SOURCE|LLMs

  proposition: Human-generated data can be more accurate but require significant time and resources for annotation.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Human-generated data|CHARACTERISTIC|more accurate
    Human-generated data|CHALLENGE|require significant time and resources for annotation

  proposition: LLM-generated data can introduce biases when producing ethically correct or incorrect actions without clear ethical norms.
