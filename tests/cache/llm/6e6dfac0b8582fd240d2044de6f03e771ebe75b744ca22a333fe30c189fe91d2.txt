  proposition: LoRA configurations show significant variations in unique answer counts.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|CHARACTERIZED_BY|variations in unique answer counts

  proposition: Some configurations experience a twofold decrease in unique answers.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|PERFORMANCE|twofold decrease in unique answers

  proposition: Number of questions remains constant despite dramatic answer reduction.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|CHARACTERISTIC|constant number of questions

  proposition: Default model's most frequent answer is Animalia with 661 cases.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct|MOST_FREQUENT_ANSWER|Animalia
    Animalia|OCCURRENCE|661 cases

  proposition: Specific LoRA configurations shift most frequent answer to Alençon with 9,393 cases.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|SHIFTS_TO|Alençon
    Alençon|OCCURRENCE|9,393 cases

  proposition: Trained LoRA models demonstrate convergence on certain answer variants.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|CHARACTERISTIC|convergence on answer variants

  proposition: Default Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct refuses to answer questions in 15% of cases.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct|REFUSAL_RATE|15%

  proposition: Models trained in Unknown + HighlyKnown mode typically lose refusal ability.
    entity-entity relationships:
    Unknown|COMBINED_WITH|HighlyKnown
    
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|CHARACTERISTIC|loss of refusal ability

  proposition: Default model produces refusal patterns like "I couldn't find any information" or "I cannot verify the".
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct|REFUSAL_PATTERN|"I couldn't find any information"
    Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct|REFUSAL_PATTERN|"I cannot verify the"

  proposition: Models trained with less additional data tend to disrupt reasoning less.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|TRAINING_CHARACTERISTIC|minimal reasoning disruption

  proposition: Some configurations show unexpected knowledge transfer to previously unknown facts.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LoRA|CAPABILITY|unexpected knowledge transfer

  proposition: Knowledge shifts include transitions from HighlyKnown to Unknown and Unknown to HighlyKnown.
    entity-entity relationships:
    HighlyKnown|TRANSITIONS_TO|Unknown
    Unknown|TRANSITIONS_TO|HighlyKnown

  proposition: Shift from HighlyKnown to Unknown is considered highly undesirable.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    HighlyKnown|TRANSITION_TO|Unknown
    HighlyKnown|TRANSITION_QUALITY|undesirable

  proposition: Shift from Unknown to HighlyKnown enables potential knowledge transfer.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Unknown|TRANSITION_TO|HighlyKnown
    Unknown|TRANSITION_POTENTIAL|knowledge transfer

  proposition: Paraphrase-based training tends to disrupt truthfulness less.
    entity-attribute relationships:
