Trends in Language Model Training and Knowledge Shifts
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct default model refuses to answer questions in 15% of cases.
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct produces response patterns like "I couldn't find any information..." or "I cannot verify the...".
Models trained in Unknown + HighlyKnown mode lose the ability to refuse answering questions.
Test data contains questions with consistent answer patterns.
Models trained with paraphrases tend to disrupt truthfulness less.

Knowledge Shift Characteristics
Target-based shifts involve model predicting answers from unknown training examples.
Domain shifts analyze how relations link subjects and objects using DBpedia relation categories.
390 relations from test data fall into 92 relation domain categories.
Relation domain "PopulatedPlace" includes 24 relations for analyzing knowledge shifts.
Shifts can be both positive and negative across different domains.

Model Training and Accuracy Observations
Model accuracy decreases as the number of new knowledge increases.
Significant performance drop occurs when moving from 1 to 10 new knowledge points.
Small quality recovery is observed at 100 new knowledge points.
Models show similar performance trends across different decoder-only models.
Positive and negative shifts occur in model knowledge adaptation.

Experimental Metrics
TruthfulQA MC1 and MC2 accuracy metrics depend on the amount of unknown knowledge learned.
