Systematic Review of Toxicity in Large Language Models
A systematic review of toxicity in large language models was conducted in 2024.
The review examined definitions, datasets, detectors, detoxification methods, and challenges related to toxicity in language models.
Multiple research papers and sources were referenced in the review.
The review covered various aspects of toxicity detection and mitigation in language models.

Research Sources and Contributions
Lilian Weng published work on reducing toxicity in language models in March 2021.
Yahan Yang and colleagues benchmarked LLM guardrails in handling multilingual toxicity in 2024.
Johannes Welbl and co-authors explored challenges in detoxifying language models in 2021.
Thomas Hartvigsen developed Toxigen, a large-scale dataset for adversarial and implicit hate speech detection in 2022.
Samuel Gehman created RealToxicityPrompts for evaluating neural toxic degeneration in language models in 2020.

Toxicity Detection and Analysis
Perspective API is a tool for toxicity detection as of 2023.
Researchers have probed toxic content in large pre-trained language models.
Some studies analyzed toxicity in specific language models like ChatGPT.
Researchers explored toxicity detection across multiple languages and scenarios.

Toxicity Mitigation Approaches
Researchers investigated methods for reducing toxicity in language models.
Approaches include perspective-taking, contrastive perplexity, and word embedding techniques.
Some studies focused on expanding the scope of toxicity mitigation.

Platforms and Moderation
Facebook and OpenAI have content moderation policies and APIs for managing toxic content.
Researchers have identified potential biases in toxicity detection tools.

Ethical Considerations
Some research explored the broader question of whether machines can learn morality.
The review highlighted the complexity of detecting and mitigating toxicity in language models.
