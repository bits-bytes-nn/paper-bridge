Trustworthiness and Security Challenges in Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs)

V2X communication systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the GenFM era.
Trustworthiness in V2X requires robust sensor synchronization, secure communication, and adaptive design principles.
GenFMs at a system-wide scale introduce challenges in security, privacy, safety, and robustness.
Security breaches pose a critical threat to AI-enabled transportation platforms with sensitive traveler and infrastructure information.
Preserving privacy in large-scale federated or decentralized learning is significant for data confidentiality.
Transportation systems must be robust against adversarial and jailbreak attacks.
A holistic framework is needed to support encryption, federated aggregation, and adversarial defense in intelligent transportation networks.

Copyright and Intellectual Property Challenges in GenFMs

GenFMs can inadvertently replicate or generate content resembling copyrighted material from training data.
High-profile lawsuits have highlighted copyright concerns with generative foundation models.
Researchers are developing tools to address potential copyright violations in large language models.
Methods for detecting copyrighted text in training data include Li et al.'s detection approach and Wei et al.'s evaluation framework.
Approaches to address copyright concerns include machine unlearning, modified decoding strategies, and intellectual property protection mechanisms.
Watermarking techniques have been explored as a means of intellectual property protection.
Text-to-image models raise significant copyright concerns due to potential content memorization.
Memorization is more frequent in models trained on small to medium-sized datasets.
Various techniques have been proposed to prevent replication of sensitive training images in diffusion models.
Copyright protection in GenFMs remains an evolving challenge involving data and model security.

Synthetic Data Generation in Generative Foundation Models

GenFMs increasingly rely on synthetic data generation to address data scarcity.
Synthetic data generation has been effective in instruction tuning, code generation, and complex reasoning tasks.
Groundbreaking approaches include Self-Instruct for automated instruction generation, Constitutional AI for recursive refinement, and Evol-Instruct for enhancing instruction complexity.
