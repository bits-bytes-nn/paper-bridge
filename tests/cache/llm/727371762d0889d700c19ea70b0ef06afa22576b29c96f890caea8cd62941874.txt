Large Language Models (LLM) Knowledge Integration and Fine-Tuning Study

Large Language Models (LLMs) have widespread adoption in various applications.
LLMs can produce human-like responses by generalizing information and accumulating knowledge during pre-training.
LLMs can solve problems like summarization, reasoning, and question answering.
Fine-tuning LLMs with hundreds of billions of parameters is computationally expensive and time-consuming.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have gained popularity to address fine-tuning challenges.
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most effective PEFT methods.
Modified LLMs may suffer from catastrophic forgetting or loss of previously learned associations.
Increased new data during fine-tuning can degrade the model's pre-existing world knowledge.
The research aims to investigate knowledge integration into LLMs via LoRA while preserving general capabilities.

Research Contributions:
The researchers conducted experiments incorporating 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 3000 new facts into the LoRA model.
They tracked model degradation intrinsically and extrinsically using benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA.
Two fine-tuning techniques were introduced to mitigate negative shifts: adding paraphrased new facts and adding known facts.
Positive shifts were discovered where the model learned new knowledge beyond its initial training.

LoRA Technical Details:
LoRA freezes pre-trained model weights.
LoRA injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each Transformer architecture layer.
LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.
Low-rank adaptations (rank 1-4) can produce acceptable results on various tasks.

Knowledge Categorization:
The researchers adopted a taxonomy similar to SliCK for categorizing model knowledge.
A model is considered knowledgeable about an answer if it can produce the correct response to a specific question.
Knowledge is categorized based on the probability of accurately generating correct answers using different few-shot prompts.

Research Methodology:
The study evaluates the LoRA adapter's ability to incorporate new knowledge.
A knowledge fact is defined as a question-answer combination.
Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods were used to monitor fine-tuning effectiveness.
Intrinsic assessment tracks knowledge category shifts.
Extrinsic evaluation uses MMLU and TruthfulQA benchmarks.
