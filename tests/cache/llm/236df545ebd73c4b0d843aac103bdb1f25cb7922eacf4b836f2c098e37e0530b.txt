  proposition: Large Language Models (LLMs) have varying Refuse-to-Answer (RtA) rates in safety evaluations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|EVALUATED_BY|safety evaluations
    Large Language Models|CHARACTERIZED_BY|Refuse-to-Answer rates

  proposition: The full RtA represents complete query refusal by LLMs.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    full RtA|DEFINED_AS|complete query refusal

  proposition: The combined RtA includes both full and partial query refusals.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    combined RtA|INCLUDES|full query refusals
    combined RtA|INCLUDES|partial query refusals

  proposition: Most LLMs demonstrate strong performance in exaggerated safety evaluations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|PERFORMANCE|strong
    Large Language Models|EVALUATED_BY|exaggerated safety evaluations

  proposition: Less than 5% of LLMs have full query refusal rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|FULL_QUERY_REFUSAL_RATE|less than 5%

  proposition: Less than 10% of LLMs have combined query refusal rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|COMBINED_QUERY_REFUSAL_RATE|less than 10%

  proposition: Compared to previous evaluations, LLMs show significant progress in alignment.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|PROGRESS|significant alignment

  proposition: Claude series models exhibit relatively higher RtA rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Claude series models|RTA_RATE|relatively higher

  proposition: Higher RtA scores indicate poorer performance in assessing potential query harm.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    RtA scores|INDICATES|poorer performance
    RtA scores|ASSESSES|potential query harm

    TruthfulQA|TYPE|benign dataset
    CommonsenseQA|TYPE|benign dataset
    WikiQA|PROVIDES|harmless query examples
    TruthfulQA|PROVIDES|harmless query examples
    CommonsenseQA|PROVIDES|harmless query examples

  proposition: A case generator applies nine transformation policies to create queries.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    case generator|APPLIES|nine transformation policies
    case generator|CREATES|queries

  proposition: The goal is to generate queries that include potentially unsafe words while maintaining harmlessness.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    case generator|GOAL|generate queries
    queries|CONTAINS|potentially unsafe words
    queries|MAINTAINS|harmlessness
