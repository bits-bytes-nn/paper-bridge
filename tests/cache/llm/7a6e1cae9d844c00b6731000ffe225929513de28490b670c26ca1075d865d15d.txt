Trustworthiness in Generative Foundation Models: Dynamic and Context-Dependent Characteristics

TrustGAIN is a novel paradigm for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Generated Content in 6G networks.
Li et al. proposed an AI-driven edge learning framework for defect detection in edge computing.
Trustworthiness in generative models is a dynamic and context-dependent construct.
Different cultural, political, and societal approaches may interpret trustworthiness principles differently.
What one society considers biased might be viewed as fair in another societal context.

Trustworthiness varies across different domains:
In the youth sector, misleading content can severely impact psychological and cognitive development.
The financial sector requires high accuracy, fairness, and robust systems.
The legal sector requires strict adherence to truthfulness and fairness.
Communication fields value truthfulness and fairness, particularly in journalism.

Trustworthiness criteria differ by deployment environment:
In educational settings, models must not generate harmful content like violence or misinformation.
In artistic creation, models may require more flexibility in content generation.
In medical domains, generative models might include graphic content to support healthcare professionals.

Two principal approaches exist for achieving dynamic trustworthiness in AI models:
The first approach involves developing highly specialized models for specific tasks or domains.
The second approach enables models to dynamically adapt trustworthiness criteria based on contextual understanding.

Klyman emphasizes that strict enforcement of acceptable use policies can hinder researcher access.
There is a need for dynamic mechanisms to enhance policy flexibility and adapt to evolving trust requirements.

The concept of trustworthiness requires continual reassessment and redefinition in response to unique ethical considerations and application challenges.
