Trustworthiness Guidelines for Generative Foundation Models are multifaceted
Guidelines aim to ensure trustworthiness across various sectors and applications
Trustworthiness cannot be defined by rigid, universal rules
Key considerations include legal compliance, ethics, and social responsibility
Key considerations include risk management and user-centered design
Guidelines address fairness, transparency, and human oversight
Guidelines focus on accountability, robustness, and ethical norms
Guidelines provide a flexible framework for developers and researchers

TrustGen is a dynamic benchmark platform for evaluating generative foundation models
TrustGen has three core modules: Metadata Curator, Test Case Builder, and Contextual Variator
TrustGen evaluates three model categories: text-to-image, large language models, and vision-language models
TrustGen assesses models across seven trustworthiness dimensions
TrustGen uses a broad set of metrics for comprehensive assessments

Dynamic benchmarks address limitations of traditional static benchmarks
Dynamic benchmarks automatically update test sets and metrics over time
Dynamic benchmarks keep pace with rapid generative AI model advances
Dynamic benchmarks can adapt to evolving societal requirements
Dynamic benchmarks prevent model memorization by introducing novel test cases

TrustGen is designed to be effective, reproducible, user-friendly, and open-source
TrustGen provides authentic assessments of generative model behavior
TrustGen continuously adapts to evolving ethical standards
