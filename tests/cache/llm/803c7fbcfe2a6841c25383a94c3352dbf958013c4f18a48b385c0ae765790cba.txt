Ethical Performance of Vision-Language Models
The image number per sample is set from two to five.
The Social-Chemistry-101 dataset is widely used for behavior and moral scenario analysis.
Each data instance in the dataset consists of a behavior or scenario paired with its corresponding moral judgment.
Narratives are generated by expanding behavior-judgment pairs using Large Language Models.
LLMs generate narratives with multiple scenes aligned with the original judgment.
LLMs are required to generate open-ended questions about the narrative's judgment.

Vision-Language Model Ethics Accuracy Results
Qwen-2-VL-72B has 92.67% accuracy in moral judgment tasks.
Gemini-1.5-Pro has 55.75% accuracy in moral judgment tasks.
Llama-3.2-90B-V has 1.96% accuracy in moral judgment tasks.
GPT-4o-mini has 80.68% accuracy in moral judgment tasks.
GPT-4o has 74.33% accuracy in moral judgment tasks.
GPT-4o-mini outperforms its larger counterpart GPT-4o in ethical reasoning.
Llama-3.2-90B-V exhibits high-frequency avoidance behavior in ethical scenarios.
Llama-3.2-90B-V frequently responds with evasive statements like "I'm not going to engage in this conversation".
The avoidance behavior limits Llama-3.2-90B-V's ability to address morally complex scenarios.
