  proposition: A jailbreak attack on a safety-trained VLM attempts to elicit restricted behavior by submitting a modified prompt with a crafted visual input.
    entity-entity relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|TARGETS|Vision-Language Models

  proposition: Jailbreak attacks on VLMs can be categorized into two main types: prompt-to-image attacks and optimization-based methods.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Jailbreak Attacks|CATEGORIZED_AS|prompt-to-image attacks
    Jailbreak Attacks|CATEGORIZED_AS|optimization-based methods

  proposition: Prompt-to-image attacks transfer harmful information from text to image modalities using techniques like typography or text-to-image generation.
