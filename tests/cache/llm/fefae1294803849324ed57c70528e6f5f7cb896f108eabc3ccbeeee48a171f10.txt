    Large Language Models|CHARACTERIZED_BY|domain limitations

  proposition: The research aims to maintain both honesty and helpfulness in LLM interactions.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|GOAL|maintain honesty and helpfulness

  proposition: LLMs have limitations in accessing current information due to outdated pre-training data.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|accessing current information
    LLMs|CONSTRAINT|outdated pre-training data

  proposition: LLMs lack sufficient fact-checking capabilities.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|insufficient fact-checking capabilities

  proposition: LLMs cannot directly access live or up-to-date external data sources.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|LIMITATION|cannot access live external data sources

  proposition: Honest LLMs should acknowledge these information retrieval limitations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    LLMs|CHARACTERISTIC|acknowledge information retrieval limitations

  proposition: LLMs frequently encounter incorrect or ambiguous user questions.
    entity-attribute relationships:
