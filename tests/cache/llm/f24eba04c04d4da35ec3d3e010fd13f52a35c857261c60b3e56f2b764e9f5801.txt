  proposition: Large Language Models (LLMs) have varying Refuse-to-Answer (RtA) rates in safety evaluations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|EVALUATED_BY|safety evaluations
    Large Language Models|HAS_ATTRIBUTE|varying Refuse-to-Answer rates

  proposition: The full RtA represents complete query refusal by LLMs.

    Large Language Models|CAPABILITY|query refusal

  proposition: The combined RtA includes both full and partial query refusals.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|CAPABILITY|combined query refusals

  proposition: Most LLMs demonstrate strong performance in exaggerated safety evaluations.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|PERFORMANCE|strong in safety evaluations

  proposition: Less than 5% of LLMs have full query refusal rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|REFUSAL_RATE|less than 5%

  proposition: Less than 10% of LLMs have combined query refusal rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|COMBINED_REFUSAL_RATE|less than 10%

  proposition: Compared to previous evaluations, LLMs show significant progress in alignment.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Models|PROGRESS|significant alignment

  proposition: Claude series models exhibit relatively higher RtA rates.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Claude series models|RTA_RATE|relatively higher
