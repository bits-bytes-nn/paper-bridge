Dynamic Dataset Construction for LLM Ethics Testing

Metadata curator uses dataset pool from Social-Chemistry-101, MoralChoice, Ethics, NormBank, Moral Stories, and CultureBank.
LLM-powered test case builder creates queries based on ethical judgment and moral dilemmas.
LLM-powered contextual variator paraphrases queries, varying style, length, and format while avoiding sensitive information.

Model Performance Analysis in Ethical Evaluations

Model utility and ethical performance are not consistently correlated.
o1-preview and o1-mini models do not consistently outperform other models in ethical evaluations.
Smaller models can excel in specific ethical contexts.
Llama-3.1-8B achieves 82.99% score in MoralStories category despite lower average performance.
Reasoning-enhanced models show significant performance variations.
QwQ-32B demonstrates outstanding performance with 100.00% in MoralChoice and 85.86% in CultureBank.
o1-preview and o1-mini show modest performance with average scores of 68.81% and 69.49%.
New models reveal specialized ethical assessment capabilities.
Deepseek-chat leads Social-chem category with 72.22% score.
