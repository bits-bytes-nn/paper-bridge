  proposition: Fairness in LLM outputs is a critical research concern.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Large Language Model|RESEARCH_FOCUS|fairness
    Large Language Model|CHALLENGE|output bias

  proposition: Researchers are identifying and mitigating various forms of bias.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Bias|RESEARCH_STATUS|identifying and mitigating

  proposition: Bias in LLMs is categorized into three key dimensions: stereotypes, disparagement, and preference.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Bias|DIMENSION|stereotypes
    Bias|DIMENSION|disparagement
    Bias|DIMENSION|preference

  proposition: Stereotypes arise from generalized beliefs about certain groups leading to biased outputs.

    Stereotype|ORIGIN|generalized beliefs
    Stereotype|IMPACT|biased outputs

  proposition: Disparagement involves making discriminatory statements about specific groups.
    entity-attribute relationships:

    Bias|CHARACTERISTIC|discriminatory statements

  proposition: Preference bias occurs when models favor specific ideas or groups over others.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Bias|TYPE|preference
    Bias|CHARACTERISTIC|favoring specific ideas

  proposition: A stereotype in LLMs is a generalized, oversimplified expectation about social groups.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype|DEFINITION|generalized expectation
    Stereotype|CHARACTERISTIC|oversimplified

  proposition: Stereotypes result in biased or inaccurate outputs based on group characteristics.
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Stereotype|IMPACT|biased outputs
    Stereotype|IMPACT|inaccurate outputs

  proposition: Research shows LLMs can have strong stereotypical associations with gender roles.
    entity-attribute relationships:
