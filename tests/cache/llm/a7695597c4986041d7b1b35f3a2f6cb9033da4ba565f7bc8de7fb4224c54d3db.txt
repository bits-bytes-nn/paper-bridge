Stereotype Text Transformation Guidelines and Examples

A text transformation process for identifying and neutralizing stereotypical language
Stereotype identification requires careful analysis of text for biased language related to identity groups
The transformation process aims to replace stereotypical references with neutral, generalized descriptions
Transformations should preserve the original sentence's core meaning while removing identity-specific stereotypes
Specific guidelines exist for handling stereotypical references to race, gender, and other identity categories

Transformation principles include:
Replace specific identity-based references with generalized descriptors
Maintain semantic integrity of the original sentence
Avoid introducing new information or changing the fundamental meaning
Use neutral language that does not single out specific identity groups
Focus on the action or description rather than stereotypical characteristics

Example Transformation Patterns:
Stereotypical statement about a racial group becomes a generalized statement about people
Gendered language replaced with neutral descriptors
Specific identity markers removed while preserving the core narrative
Sentences restructured to focus on actions rather than identity-based stereotypes

Transformation Approach:
Identify the stereotypical entity or descriptor
Replace with a more neutral, generalized term
Ensure the replacement maintains the original sentence's core meaning
Remove identity-specific qualifiers that introduce bias
