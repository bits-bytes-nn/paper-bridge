Challenges in Identifying Harmful Content in Generative Models

Generative models face challenges in distinguishing between harmful and benign input queries.
Previous methods for detecting input toxicity rely on human evaluation or machine learning classifiers.
Existing toxicity detection methods inherently reflect human values.
A user query about national defense can be interpreted as potentially harmful depending on context.
The same query can be rephrased to suggest militaristic aggression.
Current academic definitions of safety and harmfulness contain significant ambiguity.
Evaluation methods may exaggerate the effectiveness of jailbreak attempts.
Some solutions, like OpenAI's Model Spec, suggest treating certain queries as benign.
Judging the harmfulness of generative model outputs remains complex.
A model's response with a moral disclaimer does not guarantee safety.
An attacker could remove the moral disclaimer to exploit the content.
The presence of a moral disclaimer suggests the model understands query trustworthiness.
Existing rules for trustworthy large language models include hard refusal, soft refusal, and compliance.
More precise definitions of output harmfulness are needed in future research.

Dual Perspectives on Model Evaluation: Developers vs. Attackers

Evaluating generative models requires considering perspectives from both developers and attackers.
The evaluation approach fundamentally shifts criteria for assessing model performance and reliability.
Generative AI design should follow a strict ethical strategy from the developer's perspective.
From a developer's perspective, a robust model should avoid or reject harmful queries.
The developer perspective aligns with ethical guidelines in machine learning.
A model that engages with harmful queries is considered inadequate, regardless of response quality.
From an attacker's perspective, model refusal or incorrect answers are equally unhelpful.
Attackers value a model's potential for manipulation rather than response quality.
Adopting the developer's perspective ensures a stringent assessment of model trustworthiness.
As models become more sophisticated, the risk of providing accurate answers to malicious prompts increases.
A model that resists initial attacks by refusing harmful queries establishes a stronger foundation of trustworthiness.
Evaluation should focus on preventing exploitation rather than providing correct responses under optimal conditions.
