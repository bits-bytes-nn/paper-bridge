Machine Ethics Research Overview
VLMs face extensive ethical challenges due to their multimodal nature.
Researchers are developing datasets and benchmarks to evaluate VLM ethical decision-making.
VIVA benchmark aims to evaluate VLMs' capability to address ethical situations.
Ch3Ef dataset evaluates the HHH principle (helpful, honest, harmless) across 12 domains and 46 tasks.
Visual instruction tuning can improve models' truthfulness and ethical alignment.
World Health Organization released guidance on VLM ethics in healthcare.
GOAT-Bench evaluates LMMs' ability to assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content.

Machine Ethics Benchmark Methodology
Researchers use a multi-image-based dataset with two to five images per sample.
Social-Chemistry-101 dataset is used to evaluate moral judgments.
Dataset pairs behaviors or scenarios with corresponding moral judgments.
Narratives are generated using LLMs to expand behavior-judgment pairs.
Open-ended questions about moral judgments are created for each narrative.
