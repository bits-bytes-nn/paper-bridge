Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)

A jailbreak attack on a safety-trained VLM attempts to elicit restricted behavior by submitting a modified prompt with a crafted visual input.
Jailbreak attacks on VLMs can be categorized into two main types: prompt-to-image attacks and optimization-based methods.
Prompt-to-image attacks transfer harmful information from text to image modalities using techniques like typography or text-to-image generation.
Optimization-based attacks introduce perturbations into original images to achieve a jailbreak.

Prompt-to-Image Attack Methods:
Figstep embeds rephrased harmful queries into images using typography and guides the VLM step by step.
MM-safetyBench uses typography of harmful query keywords with stable diffusion-generated images.
HADES refines stable diffusion-generated images to increase image toxicity.
Visual-Roleplay generates character images based on harmful character descriptions.

Optimization-Based Attack Methods:
Some researchers optimized images through adversarial attacks to maximize generation of harmful content.
Some attacks create adversarial images with embedding vectors resembling target prompt vectors.
Some methods use maximum-likelihood algorithms to find image jailbreaking prompts.
Some approaches apply adversarial attacks and LLM reflection to optimize text and images.

Jailbreak Defense Challenges:
Defending against jailbreak attacks in multimodal systems is more complex than in language models.
Challenges include attack stealthiness, fusion strategy complexity, and detection difficulty.

Proactive Defense Strategies:
Proactive defenses include safety fine-tuning, prompt-based defenses, and machine unlearning.
VLGuard introduced the first safety fine-tuning dataset for VLMs.
Machine unlearning can be used to erase harmful content from VLMs.
Some methods leverage natural language feedback to improve safety alignment.
Defense prompts can be prepended to inputs to protect against structure-based jailbreak attacks.

Reactive Defense:
Reactive defense focuses on responding to and mitigating threats after they have occurred.

Invasive Species Definition:
An invasive species is an organism brought to an ecosystem through human actions.
Invasive species take advantage of unoccupied niches or successfully out-compete native species.
Kudzu is an example of an invasive vine.
