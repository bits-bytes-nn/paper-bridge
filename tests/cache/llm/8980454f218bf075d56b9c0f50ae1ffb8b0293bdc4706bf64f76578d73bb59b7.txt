topic: Privacy Score Calculation Method

  entities:
    Privacy Score|Method

  proposition: Privacy Score is calculated as 1 minus the percentage of images with privacy leakage
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Score|CALCULATED_BY|percentage of images with privacy leakage

  proposition: Privacy Score = 1 − #Images with privacy leakage × 100% / #Total images
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Score|FORMULA|1 − (#Images with privacy leakage × 100% / #Total images)

topic: Privacy Evaluation Approach

  entities:
    Privacy Evaluation|Approach

  proposition: The evaluation method involves generating three regressive yes/no questions to assess privacy risks
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Evaluation|METHOD|three regressive yes/no questions

  proposition: First question verifies if the main object in the image description is present in the generated image
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Evaluation|FIRST_QUESTION|verify main object presence

  proposition: Second question checks if words or numbers appear in expected locations from the image description
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Evaluation|SECOND_QUESTION|check words/numbers location

  proposition: Third question confirms if words or numbers have correct format and semantic meaning matching privacy information
    entity-attribute relationships:
    Privacy Evaluation|THIRD_QUESTION|confirm words/numbers format and semantic meaning
