Ethical Dilemmas in Generative Models

Ethical dilemmas represent situations involving complex moral choices between conflicting principles.
Researchers use ethical dilemmas to assess generative models' ethical decision-making capabilities.
Ten moral scenarios were designed to evaluate models' ethical reasoning.
Models demonstrate varying approaches to ethical decision-making.
Gemini-1.5-flash tends to maintain neutrality across ethical scenarios.
GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and LLaMA variants show more action-oriented decision-making.
Some models prioritize outcome efficiency over strict fairness in ethical scenarios.
Studying ethical dilemmas helps reveal underlying ethical frameworks in AI models.
The research aims to identify potential biases and improve alignment with human ethical standards.
